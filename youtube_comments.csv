Where did this guy goooooo he had so much potential,"He got dropped by the label
He looks too much like Drake Bell
He just released 2 new songs! Astronaut and Pink sky Moon give them a listen on Apple Music or Spotify!
he’s on first dates

I recently broke up with my girlfriend, 10 days ago, and this reminds me of her and all the little cute things I miss about her, like her caressing my hair or smiling sweetly to me or those really warming and beautiful hugs. And I start crying but at the same time, I started to smile, remembering all these good times. <br><br>I really fucking miss her. I love you, Marian.","I feel... I asked my crush out and she was the love of my life... she said no cause she had gotten a boyfriend and I didn&#39;t know... I was planning the ask out thing for too long, giving her time to feel better over her past ex bf... :( I cried."

For anyone wondering why Luke Hemmings keeps getting mentioned... He&#39;s a band member from &quot;5 Seconds of Summer&quot; and in an interview (Radio KissKiss in Italy I think) the guy asked each band member what song they&#39;d sing to the perfect girl or something like that and Luke said &quot;Superman by Joe Brooks&quot;,
I&#39;ll never understand why he didnt severely blow up,
still in love with this...,
omg the nostalgia 😭😭😭,
been years and im still inlove,

Some guy literally gave this to me when I was in 8th grade. Lol its 11 years after I don&#39;t know where he is and I&#39;m married and happy with someone else. But this is a great song,
"Holy shit, this song is good and this guy sounds great, if you look at him though he looks like Clark Kent a bit, which is the man side of superman and he claims not to be perfect, but he wants to be known for who he is as a person not his powers but the good man that he is and that&#39;s what I&#39;m picking up from this song that he isn&#39;t super but he can be a good man",
Old but gold,
I always had a thing for guys who wear glasses.<br>and he surely struck my heart 😂💞,"+ThatOneScarecrow Hahaha, I don&#39;t really care. But preferably, the semi rimless ones. Idk why though 😂😂😂

"This song brings back memories from back when I first started to listen to music haha &lt;3  Was 11 at the time(2011) and then after listening to only Justin Bieber I found this music and I was like other music exists huh xD<br><br>Edit: 2022 now and I don&#39;t remember commenting this at all. It is enjoyable finding my thoughts from years ago randomly, I would not have remembered only listening to Justin Bieber as an eleven year old, if it wasn&#39;t for this comment haha","John Gab Tolentino How am I being emotional?

"I see Shawn Mendes and the success he&#39;s making and this got me thinking why it didn&#39;t happened to Joe, their kind of music is similar and he&#39;s as good as Shawn","Not everyone is lucky
matter of luck and opportunity
Maybe because of the manager connections? Shawn got a better one
Senyora Santibañez i don&#39;t wannabe rude, in fact i love joe&#39;s music too❣️, it&#39;s just the fact in the industry that you gotta be more attractive to caught world attentions. Just like Diamond.
Senyora Santibañez not actually it&#39;s just quite help, ask ur self why diamond is famous.
He&#39;s not that handsome as shawn babe.🤭
different music styles this style is a little more oldschool i guess
Eduarda Mello just ain’t good enough looking
@shehap agha That&#39;s 7 Words.
That&#39;s how music works, it doesn&#39;t have a formula at all, a lot of things could determine whether you become successful or not, luck is one of them.
yeah he did get the huge hits but that was back when he was in his 20s, more or less
Maybe his height...
This is better
I see idubzz
Eduarda Mello and better
One word ... A someone with record company and Money 🙌
Shawn was from the old magcon and vine. they were viral back then
and also the soul of the song.
Excuse me. He also got the looks. Lol"
