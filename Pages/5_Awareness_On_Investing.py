    Misleading claims in investment content are a serious problem. They can lead investors to make bad decisions that could cost them money.
    
    Here are some common examples of misleading claims:
    
    - **"This investment is guaranteed to make you rich."**
    - **"This investment is risk-free."**
    - **"This investment is backed by the government."**
    - **"This investment is only available for a limited time."**
    
    If you see any of these claims, be skeptical. Do your own research before investing any money. """)
