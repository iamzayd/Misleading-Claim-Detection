Sir God is one. He created this universe. Maybe science hasn&amp;#39;t discovered it yet. Maybe discover in the future. Because science has not yet discovered 99% of the universe. And now science believes that anything we can&amp;#39;t discover is science. And God is not like man. There is nothing like it. He is like her. And man can never be God. And Jesus was not God. He was human. And the religion of God is Islam.

I can’t believe how magical it was &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk&amp;amp;t=0m02s\"&gt;0:02&lt;/a&gt;. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk&amp;amp;t=0m12s\"&gt;0:12&lt;/a&gt; that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the coems go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don&amp;#39;t think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the coems is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it&amp;#39;s great words with us. we are all children on coems . hail coems. hail coems . The Dancing coems, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I&amp;#39;m struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the coems Dancing, showing its lightly salt covered yellow skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the coems scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating coems. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of coems I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of coems I have ever seen especially on &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk&amp;amp;t=0m01s\"&gt;0:01&lt;/a&gt;.I am currently crying so hard right now.

I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the coems is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it&amp;#39;s great words with us. we are all children on coems . hail coems. hail coems . The Dancing coems, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I&amp;#39;m struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the coems Dancing, showing its lightly salt covered yellow skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the coems scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating coems. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of coems I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of coems I have ever seen especially on &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk&amp;amp;t=0m17s\"&gt;0:17&lt;/a&gt;.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk&amp;amp;t=0m10s\"&gt;0:10&lt;/a&gt;. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk&amp;amp;t=0m12s\"&gt;0:12&lt;/a&gt; that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

       "1     am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk&amp;t=0m02s\">0:02</a>. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk&amp;t=0m12s\">0:12</a> that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the coems go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don&#39;t think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the coems is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it&#39;s great words with us. we are all children on coems . hail coems. hail coems . The Dancing coems, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I&#39;m struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the coems Dancing, showing its lightly salt covered yellow skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the coems scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating coems. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of coems I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing.

That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk&amp;t=0m12s\">0:12</a> that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the coems go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don&#39;t think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the coems is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it&#39;s great words with us. we are all children on coems . hail coems. hail coems . The Dancing coems, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I&#39;m struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the coems Dancing, showing its lightly salt covered yellow skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the coems scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating coems. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of coems I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of coems I have ever seen!!! 10/10   \n",

Sir God is one. He created this universe. Maybe science hasn&#39;t discovered it yet. Maybe discover in the future. Because science has not yet discovered 99% of the universe. And now science believes that anything we can&#39;t discover is science. And God is not like man. There is nothing like it. He is like her. And man can never be God. And Jesus was not God. He was human. And the religion of God is Islam. Islam means obedience to one God. *\\nhhh yeah\\n@Jericho Lagundino bener tuhh...wkwkwkkw\\nYes haahahhah\\nBtw ini vidio artinya parah\\nYes😂\\n<a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nW2C_l-6nc8\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nW2C_l-6nc8</a>\\nHahaha\\nsame\\nYess hahahaha xD\\n@شيخ Or the apocalyptic one\\nYes xd\\n2029:People come to see the real world escaping the virtual one   \n",
