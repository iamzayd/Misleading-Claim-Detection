Not only that- but from experience if you don‚Äôt start right away it stars to melt partially and get too heavy/hard to move- if I waited I‚Äôd probably be trapped since I‚Äôm not that strong. After an hour of working I hadn‚Äôt even made it my driveway yet just trying to make a path from the door.  A farmer neighbor then starts Down the road in a bulldozer or some sort of large farm machinery that was able to push the snow and offered to clear the driveway for free.  He was checking in on everyone to make sure his neighbors were safe and had electricity.  I nearly cried I was so relieved.  I did finish my sidewalk on my own after 2 more hours- went in and slept and took care of myself till the morning of the test and aced it.

      "My neighbours who ive never met have at least 10 people living in the house and im pretty sure at least half of them dont work because theyre outside EVERY SINGLE DAY blasting music and drinking beer until 10pm and then i think \"damn, how could they pay for a house if they dont work\" and remember that if the rent is 1200$/month and 5 of them are paying rent, then that makes 240$ each per month and the other 5 are constantly cleaning and cooking and making hella noise all the time and there is nothing anyone can do because they dont speak english, so we cant even explain the issue and its also technically not against the law unless it passes 10pm, so everyone in the neighbourhood just has to put up with it while im pretty sure the person whos name is on the house doesnt even live there.\n",
