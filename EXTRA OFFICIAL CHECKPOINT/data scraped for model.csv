0,Not Misleading,"so let's say you want to get started  with this investing thing you might have  a bit of money saved it's probably not  enough for a house but you decide you  should probably invest it in something  you could invest in stocks shares  equities government bonds corporate  bonds real estate foreign exchange  crypto nfts Futures Fine Art watches  there seems to be tons of stuff out  there and you might have even seen those  ads on YouTube from the gurus talking  about day trading and trading foreign  exchange and how you could make money in  that way through investing and on top of  all of this confusion there's the very  real fear that you might lose all of  that money that you've worked so hard to  save up so in light of all of that this  is The Ultimate Guide to Investing For  Beginners and we're going to split this  video up into four parts which are going  to be time stamped down below so you can  skip around if you feel like it part one  is going to be about the basics and the  philosophy behind investing part two is  about why and how to invest your money  in stocks and shares in part three we're  going to be addressing common fears and  questions and concerns about investing  like what if I lose all my money and  then in part four we're going to talk  about fast lane investing which is an  alternative approach to the traditional  investing thing to build wealth part one  the philosophy and the basics of  investing so let's start by talking  about what is the point investing the  point of investing is for your money to  be able to make more money so let's say  you start off with a thousand dollars  that you've saved up through your  hard-earned labor now you could put that  money under your mattress or you could  put it in a bank current account but the  problem with that is that there's this  thing called inflation that you might be  reading about on the news and so your  thousand dollars might be able to buy  you a MacBook Air right now but a few  years from now when inflation goes up  that MacBook Air is going to cost twelve  hundred dollars and so over time your  money loses its purchasing power which  is why you want to ideally invest in  something because when you invest in  something your money grows magically on  its own more on that later and that  means you can combat the effects of  inflation and that brings us to the next  question which is how does the money  magically grow in the first place and  generally the philosophy behind  investing is that you buy something now  and that something makes you more money  over time and there are two ways in  which the thing that you buy can make  you more money let's say you buy a house  it costs a certain amount of money to  buy a house right now but there's two  ways the house makes you money number  one you can rent the house out and so  you're getting rental income every month  and secondly hopefully in theory the  value of the house will also rise over  time if you hadn't bought the house and  you just had that money sitting in a  bank account and over time you're going  to be losing money because inflation is  going to eat away at your savings now  houses are an interesting example  because you get rental income and it's  very easy for us to imagine what that  looks like everyone pays rent and so  you're making money but with most other  asset classes you don't have this  equivalent of rental instead a lot of  these things you're buying and then  you're hoping that you can sell them for  a higher price over time the main  exception to this is some stocks and  shares which we're going to talk about a  little bit later in the video and these  asset classes is a long list of things  that you probably have heard of but you  might not be entirely familiar with you  know we've got stocks shares and  equities which are kind of the same  thing we've got hedge funds we've got  index funds we've got bonds government  bonds corporate bonds you might have  heard some people investing in watches  and then fine arts you've probably heard  of people investing in crypto and even  gaining Lots or losing lots in my case  or losing quite a bit of money because  crypto has crashed recently and a lot of  this can get very complicated quite  quickly and so we're going to simplify  things and for the rest of this video  we're going to talk about investing in  stocks and shares because that is the  main kind of investing that normal  people like you and me can unlock fairly  easily you don't need to have large  amounts of money which you need to  invest in a house you don't need to take  on huge amounts of risk and gambling and  stuff like you need to do with crypto  and you don't need to be an accredited  investor or anything like you need to  invest in like ancient investing  companies or all this fun stuff so  stocks and shares are kind of the basics  of investing and usually when people  talk about investing their money what  they're referring to is I want to buy  some Tesla or I want to buy some Netflix  or I want to buy some Amazon and so  we're going to talk about that part two  why and how to invest in stocks and  shares so when you're investing in  stocks and shares for example you're  basically buying a percentage ownership  in the company that you're investing in  so let's say I wanted to buy shares in  Apple for example apple is a publicly  traded company which means the public  can trade Apple stock now in a dream  world I would just be able to go to  apple.com forward slash buy and I'd be  able to buy a stock of Apple and now I  own some percentage of the company in  reality I can't do that directly I have  to go through a middleman which we call  a broker but once I've gone through this  middleman platform I now personally own  a piece of Apple now I can make money  from stocks and shares in two different  ways firstly I could make money because  I'm hoping the price of Apple or  whatever stock I've invested in is gonna  rise over time so 10 years later I could  sell it for a lot more money than I  bought it fingers crossed but the second  way in which you can make money through  stocks and shares is similar to how you  make a rental income on a house because  certain companies will pay what they  call dividends so for example in the UK  there's a company called BT British  Telecom and they pay dividends so when  you own a piece of BT you're not just  hoping that the price will rise over  time they're also literally paying out  some of the profits that the company  makes to their shareholders and so if  for example you were ridiculously rich  and you owned 20 of BT then every time  they declare a dividend which might be  every three months you would get 20 of  the profits that they are Distributing  to shareholders in reality you and me  we're probably not going to own 20 of a  huge company like that because you put  that would cost absolutely billions but  instead we might get you know ten  dollars fifteen dollars twenty dollars  like five dollars 5.47 here and there  and if we invest in lots of companies  that are paying out dividends then it  feels like you've got this free kind of  rental income but really it's profits  from these companies coming into your  account every month and that's pretty  cool so at this point okay cool you can  now buy stocks in these different  companies you can own a small percentage  offset company but how are you supposed  to choose which companies should you put  all your your money in apple or Netflix  or on Disney Plus or should you go with  a shell or British Petroleum or Ralph  Lauren or like I don't know Unilever or  you know these brands that you might be  familiar with now at this point people  have varying different opinions on the  matter but I'm gonna cite Warren  Buffett's opinion on this which is also  my opinion on this which is that if  you're a beginner to investing unless  you are legitimately a financial  professional who literally does this  full-time for a living you should not  try and pick stocks the average person  will not know enough to know which  stocks to buy they won't know enough to  know when to buy them but they don't  have to because if they can buy all of  America through an index fund because  realistically you and me we're not  really going to have an insight into oh  I reckon Apple's going to do really well  because whatever or I reckon Disney's  going to do really well because whatever  there are literally Financial  professionals whose full-time day job it  is to do that kind of analysis and even  then they don't get it right A lot of  the time and so what you can instead do  is instead of worrying about stock  picking what you should do probably not  Financial advice LOL is invest in an  index fund and that begs the question  what the hell is an index one well an  index fund is a fund and a fund is a  basket like a group of stocks and shares  or other things but stocks and shares  for example and the index component  means that this fund tracks a particular  stock market index for example in the US  there is a really famous Index Fund  called the SNP 500 and this is basically  the top 500 biggest companies in the US  and you can see here these are the  components of the S P 500 right now so  Apple makes up 6.4 percent of the S P  500 because it's big company then we've  got Microsoft Amazon alphabet which is  Google Berkshire Hathaway which is  Warren Buffett's company alphabet Class  C which is also Google Nvidia Tesla  Exxon Mobile you might be familiar with  quite a lot of these companies but if we  scroll all the way down to the 500th  company we've got I don't know Ralph  Lauren and Hasbro and didn't realize  Hasbro was in the S P 500 but you can  see that Hasbro makes up 0.21 of the S P  500 compared to Apple's 6.4 because  those companies are hugely different in  I guess market cap or valuation right so  the point of the S P 500 is that it  gives you a single number that you can  graph over time of like how value able  the U.S stock market is because to be  honest most of the value of the U.S  stock market is in these 500 companies  and so if the value of these 500  companies are slowly increasing over  time which It generally does that means  the U.S stock market is doing well and  these companies are doing well and life  is all good if for example you're in a  recession where the stock market is  going down or if for example covert has  just become a thing and the stock market  has gone down that means that  collectively people have decided that  the value of these stocks is lower than  it once was and so the graph will go  down in those moments so what does this  all mean for you and me as normal retail  investors well basically what it means  is we can invest in an index fund so  let's say I put a thousand dollars into  the S P 500 Index Fund that's very good  because it means that my thousand  dollars is now split between 500 of  these companies and crucially it's split  based on the waiting in the S P 500 so  of my 1 000 that I've just put into the  S P 500 6.4 would be in Apple stock and  so now I own 64 worth of Apple stock and  that's pretty cool I now own a bit of  Apple 5.4 of that would be Microsoft so  I now own 54 worth of Microsoft stock  and 0.015 of that is going to be Ralph  Lauren which is for 498th on the S P 500  and so I now own 14 worth of Ralph  Lauren stock now this is a very good  thing and this is what Warren Buffett  recommends my view for most people the  best thing to do is still on the S P  500. he says that hey if you had an  extra hundred thousand dollars to invest  you should just put it straight into the  S P 500 or some other big Index Fund  because over time your money is going to  track the market you're not trying to  say hey I have a crucial insight into  the market and I know that apple is  going to outperform all these other  companies instead you're thinking you  know what I'm just a normal person I  don't have time to spend 80 000 hours a  week trying to research the [ __ ] out of  all this stuff I'm just gonna kind of  diversify my money across all these top  500 big companies in the US I think  overall U.S companies are going to go up  over time and therefore I don't have to  think too hard about this so what's the  alternative well we talked about how you  could theoretically pick stocks yourself  so you could say you know what I'm going  to ignore the S P 500 but chances are  you are not going to beat the market  chances are unless you just get really  lucky you're not going to be real  reliably able to get the returns that  you would get by just investing in all  500 of these companies now there have  been a bunch of studies and surveys and  Warren Buffett even did a challenge  experiment thing about this that  basically show that very few funds  overall actually outperformed the S P  500 and if you've got a fund that beats  the S P 500 I.E it does better in that  year than the S P 500 did it's unlikely  to do the same the following year and so  a lot of these phones are trying to  quote beat the market but as Warren  Buffett and a lot of these other people  say you cannot beat the market so let's  just invest in the market directly just  put your money in an index fund and  don't think too hard about it every  single person I know who has invested by  picking stocks has lost money and every  single person I know who has invested by  just investing in an index fund has made  money over time the next question that  this raises is okay cool I want to  invest in a stock market index fund how  the hell do I do that do I just go on s  p 500.com forward slash buy and buy some  index funds again it's not quite how it  works you need a bit of a middleman and  that's where these kind of online  platforms come in now this is going to  vary depending on whatever country  you're in so if you want to find a  stocks and shares investment platform in  your country then just Google that in  the UK for example there are loads the  ones that I personally use are Charles  Stanley direct because that's the first  one I started using in 2015. I also use  Vanguard Vanguard is super big and super  legit you can check it out and the app  that I use personally for investing in  individual stocks these days is trading  212 and in fact incidentally this video  is now sponsored by trading212 this is  kind of fun as you can tell I'm  recording on a different day anyway if  you want to get started with investing  training212 genuinely is the app that I  use it's the best way to get started you  can trade stocks and shares you can also  open an Isa an individual savings  account if you're in the UK one of the  cool things about trading 212 is you can  practice investing with practice money  so everything about the markets is  identical it's just that you're  investing fake money rather than real  money and if you're uncomfortable  investing real money for now this is a  great way to become more familiar with  the concept of investing and then once  you're ready to invest with real money  you can just switch using a simple  button on the app and you can deposit  money through Apple pay up to two  thousand pounds and then you can use  bank transfer subsequently and the other  cool thing about trading 212 is they've  got this really cool pies feature where  basically you can look on the app and  you can see other investment pies that  other people have created so you'll have  these like Finance Pros that are  creating their custom pies and you'll  see that they've allocated 10 to the s p  or 20 to the ftse 100 or this percenter  apple or Tesla or Microsoft or whatever  and then you can see the performance of  that specific pie over time and then  what you can do if you really want to is  you can copy and paste someone's pie  that they have built into your own  investing account and now you can  automatically with a single click invest  let's say 100 pounds into that pie and  so that 100 pounds will then be split  amongst the various allocations that the  person has decided to do in the pie and  that's great like obviously I'd still  recommend investing in some broad stock  market index fund like the S P 500 even  though I don't give Financial advice  anyway if you fancy giving a go it's  commission free it's completely free to  sign up you don't have to pay anything  you can go to trading212 it's available  on the App Store on iOS and on Android  and if you use the coupon code Ali Ali  when you sign up that will give you a  free share up to the value of 100 pounds  so you can get completely free money by  just signing up for trading 212. check  it out with a link in the video  description or search trading212 on any  of the app stores but thank you so much  trading 212 for sponsoring this video  part three common fears concerns and  questions about investing so if you're  broadly very unlikely to lose money  because Vanguard collapsed overnight but  you might lose money if the value of  your Investments goes down and this is  where people get really really worried  because they always think ah you know if  I invested my pardoned cash into these  stocks and shares what if it goes to  zero what if I lose my money now this is  a common fear and certainly let's say  you invested a thousand dollars into the  S P 500 just before the financial crash  in 2008 and then the markets crashed by  I don't know 60 or whatever it was and  so now your thousand dollars is worth  like 400 I know you're thinking oh my  God like I can't believe I've lost 60 of  my money now if at that point you sell  now you have realized the loss now  you've literally lost money because you  bought the thing for a thousand and you  sold it for 400. but if you just held on  then the market recovered over time and  by 2012 it was at the same levels and  then it was just going up and up and up  so even if you had invested lots of  money just before the 2008 financial  crisis if you had just stuck to your  guns and left that money in there you'd  be have you'd have doubled or tripled or  something your money by now because  overall the stock market broadly goes up  over a long enough time Horizon it's the  same with house prices you can buy a  house and if you try and sell it next  week then maybe the price will have gone  down but if you try and sell it 20 years  from now chances are unless your country  has been destroyed the price will have  gone up and the longer you can leave  your money in these index funds or  whatever the more it compounds over time  and as Einstein is famously put reported  to have said compound interest is the  eighth wonder of the world what are the  chances that all 500 of the biggest  companies in the US suddenly are going  to drop to zero value overnight  basically zero percent I think if all  500 of the biggest companies in the US  all have their value dropped to zero I'm  we're going to have bigger problems in  the world than the value of my stock  market portfolio and the reason why I  think it's reasonable to make the bet  that over time the stock market goes up  is because every day thousands of people  are going to work in each of these  companies every single day value is  being created by the employees at Apple  they're researching new technology  they're building new stuff they're  adding an extra camera or an extra lens  to the iPhone and all of that means that  because these people are putting in the  input of human labor you would expect  the value of the company to rise with  time because they're making more and  more cool stuff and because people are  going to want to continue to buy that  more and more of that cool stuff now  another question people sometimes have  is how much money do I need to get  started do I need to be like super rich  to start investing and the answer is no  again it depends on which platform  you're using but for example I'm trading  212 or Vanguard and Vanguard I think you  just need 100 pounds to invest trading  212 I think you can start with like 5  again this is just massively varies  depending on your country so do some  research and figure out what are the  most reputable and legit Platforms in  your country and then you can invest  based on that now there's two other  categories of stuff that I invest in I  invest in real estate so I've got a few  properties in the portfolio we're not  going to talk about that because I've  done a video about that over there  buying versus renting and that's usually  outside the range for most people until  you've already made a lot of money to be  able to afford a deposit on a house and  get a mortgage and I also invest some  amount of money in crypto yep and as we  can see here the total value of my  crypto portfolio is 200 000 but I have  actually lost 65 000 so I've put in 265k  into crypto and currently it's worth  200k what can you do I'm hoping the  price Rises with time so generally when  it comes to recommending investing in  crypto people often ask about this I  would say if you want to take the gamble  fine but make sure the only money you're  putting into your crypto account is  money that you can 100 afford to lose  don't try and think of investing in  general or crypto in particular as a get  rich quick scheme but generally if you  want to invest your money in stocks and  shares as Warren Buffett says and as I  do and as I generally recommend even  though I'm not a financial advisor not  Financial advice Etc it's pretty  reasonable to put that money in a stock  market index fund like the S P 500 for  example by the way if you're enjoying  this video so far I'd love to hear in  the comments what's been your biggest  concern about getting started with  investing what is the thing that's  holding you back part 4 fast lane  investing the alternative approach to  Building Wealth so so far we've talked  about what some people would somewhat  disparagingly called the call the slow  lane approach to Building Wealth it's  like the slow lane and this and there's  the fast lane now this is terminology  from MJ DeMarco's book of the  millionaire fast language it's actually  a really good book but the basic idea of  slow lane investing is that hey I've got  some money I'm gonna do my day job I'm  Gonna Save up 10 of my paycheck and  every month I'm gonna put 10 into my  savings account and then I'm going to  invest that money in the S P 500 and  then 50 years from now by the time I'm  65 that money will have compounded and  then I'll Be A Millionaire this is a  very very slow form of investing it's a  very slow way to build wealth and  certainly it's fine to invest in stock  market index funds I do that as well but  there is another approach to investing  and it's worth talking about that here  because when we hear investing a lot of  us just default to thinking oh I guess I  should buy stocks and shares or I guess  I need to buy a house but if we really  think about it what is the point of  investing money the point of investing  money is for your existing money to make  more money further down the line that's  all the point is the point is not to  invest in stocks and shares stocks and  shares are a vehicle by which you can  turn your money into more money further  down the line but when it comes to Fast  Lane investing fast lane investing is  basically that instead of investing in  someone else's business I.E apple or  Amazon or Google or whatever you're  investing instead in yourself and in  your own business the S P 500 goes up by  seven percent each year again on average  so if I put a thousand dollars into the  S P 500 it would be worth on average one  thousand and seventy dollars twelve  months from now and so the question  becomes can I do something better with  that thousand dollars to make more than  seventy dollars in the next 12 months  and generally the answer is hell yes  there are kind of two things I could  invest in I could invest in my own  ability to make money so for example  let's say I'm a healthcare assistant in  a hospital and I can take a course for a  hundred pounds and that course gives me  the ability to become a phlebotomist  someone who takes blood and let's say  I'm making 15 pounds an hour as a  healthcare assistant but I could be  making 25 pounds an hour as a  phlebotomist now all of a sudden I've  paid 100 pounds I've invested 100 pounds  into my own skills but I've been able to  increase my earning capacity by nearly  2X and therefore within four hours of  working as a phlebotomist I will have  paid off my hundred pound investment and  now if I work as a phlebotomist instead  of a healthcare assistant I'm now  earning more than 10 pounds an hour and  so every 10 hours of the work that I do  I'll be earning that hundred pounds back  and so my return on this hundred pounds  is way way way higher than just seven  percent because I fundamentally  increased my own value to the market  I've fundamentally increased my own  ability to make money this is why  investing in your own education is  generally a very reasonable thing to do  yes you can find out lots of stuff on  YouTube and I'm always in favor of like  hey if you're broke don't buy fancy  courses don't take out loans to buy  courses find free information on the  internet but I've got so many friends  who have an extra few thousand pounds  and they put it in the S P 500 because  they're hoping it'll grow over the next  50 years rather than just spending some  money on a weekend course on whatever  skill they want to improve and then they  can use that skill to literally make way  way more money than they would by just  sticking in the S P 500 so that's kind  of one way of Fast Lane investing you  invest in your own ability to make money  but the other way of Fast Lane investing  is by investing in your own business  obviously this only applies if you have  a business want to start a business but  generally the way to get rich quickly  quickly as in the next 10 years rather  than the next 70 years is to build your  own business to own your own business  and to increase the value of that  business rather than giving your money  to Apple or to Tesla so for example if I  wanted to I could start my own coffee  shop or my own online business or my own  YouTube channel which is a business if I  wanted to I could start my own web  design agency or social media marketing  agency if I wanted to I could learn how  to code and I could build software and I  could turn it into an app I back myself  to be able to make a business and teach  myself the basics of how to run that  business and make that business more  valuable in terms of return percentage  then the seven percent I would get in  the S P 500 and when I interviewed Alex  for Mosey who's like a 200 million  dollar entrepreneur he call he kind of  calls it in investing in the s p versus  investing in the sne it's a whole S P  500 versus SME 500 but like you will get  a significantly higher return investing  in your own ability to make make money  then you will in any any market and his  advice as well is that you should invest  in the sne you should invest in yourself  invest in your own skills invest in your  own ability to make money invest in your  own business because the Returns on that  are way more likely to be ridiculously  higher than just that crappy seven  percent that you get by investing in the  S P 500 so if for example you are  interested in investing in your own  education and you want to start a  YouTube channel and really take it  seriously and treat it like a business  you might like to check out my own  course part-time YouTuber Academy it's  great people love it it's good vibes  that'll be linked down below and that  course is basically about teaching you  the things you need to know to systemize  and scale a YouTube channel if you want  to treat it like a business it's not a  course for people who want to do it as a  hobby but if like me you want to turn  your channel into a business and make  money that way that's a course that  might help you but of course everything  is available on YouTube for free as well  so if you're broke or if you have loads  of time and not much money then of  course you can find all this information  for free on the internet anyway I hope  you found this video useful if you're  interested in learning more about this  fast lane investing approach to Building  Wealth you should check out this video  here which is my book review of the  millionaire fast lane by MJ DeMarco  which is the best book I've ever read on  how to make money in a quick fashion  quick meaning in the next 10 years  rather than the next 60 years so check  out that video over there thank you so  much for watching and I'll see you  hopefully in the next video

1, Not Misleading,"you are young I'm 17 years old you're  ambitious I worked my face off and you  want to make it big early in your life  so in today's video I'm going to reveal  the seven principles for teenagers and  people in their early 20s to become  millionaires now I made my first million  dollars at 18 years old and no matter  what you see on Tick Tock I want you to  know that that is not normal it is not  normal in any shape form or fashion but  it is because I followed these seven  principles so what I'm going to reveal  to you today not only helped me make my  first million dollars at 18 years old it  has helped me to amass a net worth of  tens of millions of dollars by the age  of 23. so I'm speaking from experience  here but I do want to make it clear that  no matter what anyone says I will hold  my hand up and say that a very large  portion of why I'm in the position I am  today is because of luck or the grace of  God in my opinion and timing so just  factor that in now real quick before we  get into today's video I've had tons of  people over the years ask me to do like  q and A's on Instagram or even here on  YouTube where I answer questions to  people's specific cases you know their  particular question and I'll be honest  my main Instagram is just a stupid place  where I post photo dumps from trips  business trips what's going on in my  life stuff like that but earlier this  year I created an Instagram account  called at talk with Eman so you can just  pull up your phone and request to follow  that account I usually tell my team to  let in a thousand or two thousand people  a week I try my best okay I'll hold my  hands up sometimes I do miss it I try my  best to do a weekly q a just answering  all of your guys's business life  questions so go ahead and follow that  account if you want a little bit more  business advice but apart from that  let's get back into the video the first  principle you need to learn if you want  to be a millionaire in your teens or  your early 20s is that in order to be a  king you must first be a pawn and this  is really the issue with this generation  and I say this generation even though I  am included in it but I grew up with  very traditional principles around  respect I come from a background that is  a mix between Eastern European and  Middle Eastern so like growing up you  have no option you learn respect and you  learn the pecking order and I learned  from a young age that you respect your  elders and that's why still to the state  I still sit across the table from people  that I'm gonna be very honest with you  are far less successful than I am but I  shut the [ __ ] up and I listen because  for me in my culture you listen to your  elders now that doesn't mean you need to  take everything that they say on board  but you at least listen and because I  grew up in this environment of learning  respect I learned that hey you can be a  king one day but in order to be a king  you first need to be a pawn you first  need to be able to earn your stripes and  by the way I earned my stripes from a  very young age I started my first  entrepreneurial Ventures when I was 14  and I learned what it was like to work  with clients and quite frankly for a  lack of a better word be their little  [ __ ] boy I learned what it was like to  pay my dues no matter what it's kind of  like listen when you're young and you  join a football team you're going to be  the one who's the ball boy at the end of  training you're going to be the one who  is expected to carry all of the  equipment to and from and you need to go  through that to one day become the  captain you don't just come in  especially as someone who is Young and  become the captain all of a sudden and  that is the issue with today's social  media [ __ ] Society they look at  things and they look at people and they  go okay I'm going to jump from here to  here and I deserve that for some reason  and I even get this to this day people  say hey man why do you recommend  business models that you used to do why  don't you recommend what you're doing  right now do you realize how stupid that  sounds do you realize why I may suggest  business models I did when I first  started my entrepreneurial Ventures or  within three years into my  entrepreneurial Ventures not now that I  am coming up to my 10th year as an  entrepreneur do you not realize why I  would suggest businesses that I started  as a pawn as someone with no resources  no connection no money nothing do you  realize why I suggest those businesses  rather than the businesses I have now  with millions of followers subscribers  tens of millions of dollars like I'm  sure you can kind of see why I think  this is better than this but this is  what I'm saying the younger generation  they look at things and they're like no  I want to jump straight to the Finish  Line you have to earn your [ __ ]  Stripes so just remember to be a king  you must first learn to be a pawn and  there is an nothing wrong with that by  the way there is honor there is no  ability in starting from the bottom of  the pecking order being quiet respecting  the process and understanding that you  will eventually work your way up the  totem pole now the next principle for  teenagers to become millionaires is  dressed to elevate and here's what I  mean by that when you are young people  are going to automatically discredit you  you don't want to make it worse by the  way that you dress so here's the thing  you can have a 30 year old that dresses  in big labels Gucci Balenciaga where's  the funny shoes and all that stuff and  listen I mean I'm not against it  sometimes when I'm feeling comfortable I  dress in streetwear but if I'm going to  an important meeting I can guarantee you  I'm not dressed like that and my point  is that you can get a 30 year old that  dresses like that that looks like a 20  year old whereas you can get a 18 or 20  year old that dresses very traditional  very classic and you can get an 18 or 20  year old that looks like they're 30. so  the point is don't spend crazy amounts  of money to have all these labels and  this and that and I don't think that's a  good idea ever unless you really can  afford ordered you have a full wardrobe  and sometimes you just want to be a  little playful my best recommendation is  just go for clothes that have no  branding No Label and I'm not saying  that you need to dress in three-piece  suits listen even if you just go in a  simple black T-shirt simple trousers  that aren't too baggy and definitely no  skinny jeans and just some classic  Timeless shape shoes listen you're not  dressing incredibly well but the point  is you can kind of hold your own in any  room sometimes less really is more so  first learn how to just dress classic  and Timeless and then later down the  line you can start incorporating some  suits you can start incorporating some  double-breasted suits maybe before you  go to the suits just get some nice  Blazers and you compare the Blazers with  trousers it doesn't need to be a full  suit you know a lot of times I'm just  very comfortable with a nice round neck  t-shirt not like this this is a lot more  you know it's a Sunday today a very home  comfortable shirt so not something as  casual as this just a nice fitted white  T-shirt or black T-shirt and smart  Blazer over the top some trousers and  some smart shoes and you have a very  classic Timeless look that's not overly  formal and you're never going to be too  overdressed in any situation and then as  I said later down the line you can get  into your double-breasted so you can get  into your three pieces whatever you feel  comfortable in really but the point is  that you really need to learn how to  dress to elevate especially if you're  going into the world of business at a  young age because I'm being honest with  you I experience this firsthand people  will try to discredit you because of  your age so don't give them any excuse  or Reason to make it an even bigger  thing than it needs to be so dress older  than you are now the third principle for  teenagers to become millionaires is have  something external that humbles you and  here's what I mean by that there's a lot  of people who are young with a lot of  ambition in their life but the issue is  there's nothing in their life that has  humbled them things that will humble you  Combat Sports business will humble you  because no matter how good you are when  you get in the world of business the  market will tell you how good you are  I'll give you a perfect example I  remember when I was 17 years old I had  gone up to I think 15 or 20 grand in my  business at that point I dropped out of  school the month prior and I hired my  first employee full-time employee fifty  thousand dollars a year which by the way  for a first employee was like at 17 that  was big for me and I'll never forget it  this person even moved country to join  my company AKA just me and within three  to four days he quit packed up his stuff  and went back to his country and was  like I do not enjoy this work and I  remember it was one of the very few  times I've ever cried in my life I  remember talking to my mom and just  crying and just being like wow I feel  like a failure your business is taking  off and you're hiring your first  employee and they leave because a the  work isn't enjoyable enough or  potentially and this is something I had  to face at the time maybe I just really  wasn't an inspiring leader maybe I  wasn't a sort of leader where my team  was like I would follow you into war and  things are very different now that I  have 150 employees we get 40 000 people  a year applying to work at one of my  companies because I was humbled when I  was 17 that hey maybe you're not as good  as you think you are maybe you think  that you're this little child prodigy  are you sure about that let me humble  you so whether it's business whether  it's Combat Sports you need something  external in your life to Humble you and  put you in your place because the thing  is especially if you earn a lot of  success at a young age you're gonna  start to think you're hot [ __ ] and if  you don't have anything to Humble you  you will end up becoming your worst  enemy the next principle you need to  follow is no casual dating either  something serious or nothing at all  listen if you are in your teenage years  or your early 20s either you go for  something serious no casual dates no  casual flings stuff like that listen you  are a man in your early years make  something of yourself and either have a  partner early on they will support you  through that as something serious or  none of this casual hinge Tinder blah  blah all this none of this casual dating  because let me tell you something it is  taking you away from your best years  your best years to build and the other  thing is we live in a very brutal dating  culture I'm gonna be very honest with  you so why b19 trying to navigate this  crazy difficult dating culture where  there's successful men all around the  world that through Instagram and all of  these other mediums have access to all  these women why would you at 19 try to  compete with that either you have that  serious girl that holds it down for you  or don't try to casual date if you want  a casual date and have your fun and  listen I'm speaking to someone who has  had both sides of the equation into the  state I still like to have my fun  there's nothing wrong with it but I put  my head down and work like a dog for  years and years and I remember even  being 19 20 and being a  multi-millionaire and I said to myself  what's the point of me really focusing  on women and having fun and enjoying  myself with all these women when girls  don't want guys for 19 or 20 and you  need to understand this as a guy you  become most attractive once you get past  the age of 25 really from 25 to 35 is  when you're most attractive to women and  it really only starts at 25. so I  remember even being 19 or 20 and I'm  like yes this is great I'm a  multi-millionaire I'm all these things  but like let me just keep working like  I'm on a roll like all momentum let me  just keep this going rather than trying  to have the most fun and date girls and  Bubba and all this crap so as I said no  casual dating either you are dating  someone serious that you're like this  woman could be that day one for me and  by the way that day one girl listen  please take this coming from me there is  nothing on Earth nothing on earth that  is more viable than that if you've got a  day one girl and you managed to get a  day one girl you know all these girls on  a y'all private job I have done and  still do all these things but I  understand that that does not come  remotely close to a day one girl who is  there from you from the jump from day  one so either aim for that because by  the way that is the most valuable thing  you could ever get in life I'm telling  you this so either you get that or just  don't casual date because you are in  your building phase you have so long  especially as a man and I know I keep  talking to men and I understand that  there's a I think 10 of my audience is  women and I always do say I make content  specifically for men because I grew up  without a dad I had to learn all this  myself so that's why I speak to the  young men out there but I know a lot of  women still watch my videos and take  lessons from it and stuff like that so  as I was saying keep your head down keep  focused no casual dating [ __ ] and  then once you've made something of  yourself pop your head up and and then  you can have a little bit of fun before  eventually hopefully one day you find  your actual Queen principle number five  is keep your circles small but your  influence large and here's what I mean  by that there is nothing wrong with many  people knowing you or with you having  many acquaintances but you should have  very few friends and here's the thing  most people in this [ __ ] fake life  don't know the difference between an  acquaintance and a friend because most  people don't understand what true  loyalty is they are around people that  they don't like they're around people  for clout or money and this and that and  that's why by the way it's so important  to get yourself strong first so this way  people later down line can't throw money  or women or clout at you and you're  impressed by it you need to make  yourself strong you need to make  yourself a fortress but back to the  point keep your circle tight but you're  influence large many people can and  should know of you and I'm not talking  about having a massive social media  following or this or that I just mean  even in the industry you're in never  unnecessarily burn Bridges always be  very polite and courteous to people but  always understand that you can probably  only have a select handful of true  friends true Brothers in Arms true  people that will love you and do  anything for you that's a very very  small circle so your circle of influence  can and should be large but keep your  actual Circle solid and full of good  people the next principle you need to  follow is that God will always test you  to see what you can handle and if you  can't he will take it away from you and  this is very very important because  becoming successful and making your  first million in your teens or your  early 20s that's great congratulations  can you keep it now and not only can you  keep it can you multiply it because  that's a lot of pressure listen if you  make your first million dollars when  you're 18 or you're 20 or you're you  know even 23 that's great but that's a  lot of pressure every year after that  can you hold that same standard so you  need to understand that God If He  blesses you if he gives you that million  at a young age he's gonna see if you can  handle it he's gonna see if you can  humble yourself that's why earlier I  told you have things external in your  life that will constantly humble you  business martial arts setting challenges  for yourself and seeing if you can  accomplish things that really make you  dig deep because here's the thing if you  don't have these external things to  Humble you if you don't humble yourself  God will humble you and when God humbles  you it's with a ferocity you can't even  imagine because you're not ready for it  yet as quickly as it's given it's taken  away and you need to understand these  things so as long as you go into it with  a mindset that when you make your first  million you're not going to be driving  around in the G-Wagon and you're gonna  go to the bank like a idiot and take out  thirty thousand dollars in cash so that  way you can do an Instagram story where  you spread all the money in your hands  and now all you do is listen to little  baby in your rented G-Wagon and pop  bottles at the beach club and now your  business is just on autopilot God will  put you in your place so before that  happens put other things in place I've  already given a few but even if you can  get an older Mentor an older Confidant  to look at you and be like you ain't  doing it once is nothing special you're  only a legend if you can do it back to  back to back that's when you're a legend  now the last principle to tie it all  together is invest early and invest as  much as you can here is the thing if you  make money at a young age try to get  away from you as soon as possible I'm  talking about property I'm talking about  maybe even buying some physical gold I'm  talking about things where the money can  get away from you and it's not easy to  sell here's the issue sometimes and I'm  not totally opposed to it here's  sometimes the issue with crypto or  stocks you can buy and sell very easily  you can't buy and sell real estate very  easily so buying things that aren't  actually very liquid at a young age I  think later down the line once you're  established that can actually be a  detriment actually makes things a little  bit more difficult but when you're a  young age you are your worst enemy  you're the probably the biggest reason  you're gonna [ __ ] this up so what you  want to do is once you make money push  it away as quick as possible because  here's the other thing and once again  I'm talking from experience when you are  young and you make a lot of money you  know what people think people don't  think oh well done people think you got  lucky so there's no point being 19 years  old driving all these supercars and blah  blah all this stuff because you're not  impressing anyone people just think  you're lucky that's it you're better off  taking the money investing it and when  you're 23 you're 25 you get to an age  where people can kind of believe this  has happened a little bit more maybe you  know you're 22 but you're dressed apart  and people think you're a little older  and that's when you can enjoy and you  can live it up and you can do these  things because when you get out of your  Supercar people will actually think that  you bought that but when you're 19 and  you look young people will either think  you got lucky they're going to think you  invest in some pump and dumb coin or  they're gonna think Daddy's money so  while you're trying to flex and let's be  honest if you're young and you're buying  these supercars you're probably trying  to flex it's not even having the  intended effect so just tell yourself  you know what any money that comes in  I'm gonna invest as much as I humanly  can I'm gonna make myself solid and I'm  gonna enjoy these things a little later  down the line so ladies and gentlemen I  present to you these principles as  someone who can speak to you more  realistically because let's be honest a  lot of these YouTube videos you watch  online are some 50 year olds that lived  in a different generation and don't  understand that hey there's nothing  wrong with wanting beautiful women  around you there's nothing wrong with  wanting money having nice cars all these  things there's nothing wrong with that  but there's a way to do it there's a  time and a place so I'm just coming here  and speaking to you guys from experience  and trying to meet you guys of where you  are which is not trying to shame you for  the things you want in life but just  telling you there is a way to do it and  there's a right timing to do things so  as I said I hope this has been a value  to you as a reminder I'm a little bit  more active on that talk with Iman for  actual sort of business q and A's so go  ahead and follow that account and as  always I'm watching from afar and I'm  rooting for you

a blogger the one watching this video so simply what you do is you start writing content around gromo app okay let me show you now what content can I write around it...okay If you simply search GroMo,it has less number of reviews ok gromo's reviews are less So what can you do, you can review content basically in which many people who are there they can join by referring it Let's suppose you have to promote a financial product to promote a financial product, I tell you a simple strategy as many bloggers are there You put content around their products let's suppose if you have to promote IDFC credit card auction okay...how much was that,worth 1400/- okay now what you can do,review on IDFC bank credit card same thing I told you post review you can aslo write,Where can you get the best credit card for bloggers as well as digital marketor and for youth, this is for bloggers Now let's talk about those people who work on Instagram Now let's suppose you are already working on your pages I would say you make a new page,now let me tell you about new page as you can see I also have lots of followers on Instagram If you don't follow you can follow now If you are also active on Instagram and first of all,before selling financial products you need to know about finance or basic financial knowlege is required if you don't have confidence then you cannot sell this product First of all you have to take financial education,okay You will find many videos go and watch even if you work for 30 days, you can easily earn money you can also learn financial education, start watching videos everyday Share what you have learned on Instagram through the reels,reels is pretty good platform I had put a reel, it was seen by 22K people there are 22K people and if suppose I am promoting a product then don't you think 40 people can be convert okay...it's easy,try to make these kinds of videos GUYS!

3,Misleading,"Let's answer one of my questions. Without investing money, 50,000 or more, is this possible to earn every month. Many people will say to you that earning 50000 without investing money is not impossible. We cannot earn it. But today in this video I am going to tell you exactly about a platform by which not only 50000 but you can earn much more money than it every month, and that too without any investment. See, the internet has made work very easy, technology has made it so easy that you can earn money through your mobile phone by sitting at your home or from your office or at any beachside  Now you may not believe me because there are many platforms on the internet, Who to trust? Which is a safe and secured platform, I will tell you and you will also earn money continuously, now if one thing you have understood here is that If you want to earn money here and you are getting such a platform from which you can earn without investing money, then you should give a lot of importance to this video because this is an earning related video and you must share this video with your many friends who want to earn money through the internet, I tell you about a platform which is gromo, many people have asked me about gromo that how to earn money through this platform and many people even have heard about gromo so far, I will tell you from the whole base what this platform does and what services it is providing you and in what way you will you get money through gromo. Now see what happens, that Necessity is the Mother of Invention, in India, see what Necessity People want a side income. Who does not want to have a side income and people did not know the methods for that side income, that's a big thing, now many such big companies offer that if you recommend their services or products, then you can earn money. I have also told you about many companies before about referring and earn and Today I am going to tell you about a platform, as I said that name of this platform is gromo, if you will go on this then this company is a distribution company of financial products, now this company was started by Ankit Khandelwal and Darpan Khurana. So these two people have started this company. Both people are IITians, they have completed their graduation from IIT Delhi, and after it, they have experience of 12 years in the business, they have led many startups and now they are solving the biggest problem of India, and that is to earn money. So how they are doing it, let me explain to you. The gromo company, they have partnered with more than 20 financial companies which are giving financial products and services and you saw their products on gromo. You can share these financial products online with your friend circle and with your relatives, and on your internet and you also have some friends who are on the internet. Now it comes to how we will do it, we are new to it and we don't know anything. Gromo has made your job very easy, Gromo provides you, firstly it provides you live webinars. Apart from this, it provides you with tutorial videos so that you can know in which way you will recommend your financial product, then what is its process and how will you get the money Apart from this, they have video courses, which you can learn by watching how you are going to earn money. Apart from this, you get support to create a personalized website, you have to make your visiting cards and Gromo becomes like your helping partner. Now you are associating with Gromo then you should know that more than 3 lakh partners have associated with them, who are recommending their financial products by visiting their platform and like I said that 50,000 and they are making more money than it. Now a question comes after it whether it has any registration fees, the answer is no, it does not have any registration fee. Now the vision of Gromo is simple: people in India can earn money by selling financial products and services and can earn money by recommending and it is free to do, so if you want a side income then your search is and. So, I'll show you their application on the phone. I turn on the screen recording of my phone so that I Can Show You Exactly what you have to do on this application. There is a link to Gromo in the description and comment box, so if you go through this link and download the gromo then you will have some exclusive benefits and as you will go to Gromo and you will install some apps then it will ask your preferred language, you can select Hindi or English, then I continue on English. But see here that financial products are showing that there are saving accounts here and loans and credit cards and demat accounts, you can earn 50000 or more here. So there are timely payments and you can also earn money by referring and earning. So here I have told you that this is also a good option. Let me tell you about it and like I have said that there are above three lakh partner's, so we can log in here. My number has come here, so I use it here as OTP will come, Now we have a login here now you see. First, it is visible on the homepage on the front that you are getting extra 100 rupees on your first sale, with this, here is your bumper price that you can win an iPhone 12, and offers valid for different times and apart from this you are getting ₹350 for recommending and here you can recommend your demat account to people and you can recommend savings account and you can recommend credit card and you can also recommend subscriptions and you can earn money through them. Now see here as I talk about live webinars, you can see here clearly that there is product training happening there and you can register here and similarly, there is Product training for Free Charges happening there, so by clicking on seeing more you can see the product training and webinars, so with it, you can see details of Courses here and you can join different courses by which you will get to learn that how you can grow your business. The downloadable posters you can see here. The biggest thing is that your name will already be printed on the posters, so you have to do nothing You can use these products directly to use them on your social media. As you will earn money there, you can transfer it to your bank instantly. You just have to go to Wallet section and after it, you can avail yourself the option directly of transfer to the the the the the the the the bank, now see why this is important, let me explain you and as I said that there is academy here for courses, you can see leads here and, on their home screen, you can see that you can also watch a video for using Gromo app and take live training and below that you are also getting the tools which I told you that you can make your visiting card and you can earn money by doing referral and earning. You can access your diary here and also unlock your website. It will be unlocked after your first sale. Now let me clear you the benefit of referring and earning. Here when you go to Refer and Earn, you will click on share, then your referral link will be generated here, by which you can share in your friend circle. The biggest advantage of referring and earning is that you get an earning of five per cent, it is earning for a lifetime and you get tremendous benefits in one time on the gromo app. And if you need any kind of help and support then you can go to support on the top right corner of the app and you can get the solution of your query, then they have made a very clean and clear dashboard. So you can install this app. The link is in the description and the comment box and I will explain to you how it will work. Now you have understood that you are going to earn money on different financial products. Now let us understand what are the ways to bring leads. First of all, you should make a list of warm markets. Now How does this warm market list start? Let me explain to you. What is this warm market and what is this cold market? These are the common words in the sale. You pick up your phonebook and see, you need a side income. Many people want side income and there will be many people who want financial products. So you make a list of two people, one of those who need extra earnings or those who need extra income, then one is a category of extra income, you can put name 1,2,3 here and after that, you can create another category, those who need the products and services, then you can make a list of them and after that, you can call your friends to step by step and you can tell them on call or you can tell them about gromo on WhatsApp. Now that you have made and you have worked on it, then let's assume that you have made a list of 100 people and out of 100 you have 20, 30, and 40 people associated with you. Now definitely you will get some earnings from them but you will say that this earning is limited, and it can also stop after some time because people are limited. Now, this was about the market, now let's also understand the cold market. Now the cold market means that the people you don't know, there were People in the warm market whom you know, you recommended them one time, the thing is money has come. But now we need money continuously and for that, you made a funnel on social media, now what does it mean. Let me explain to you when we talk about social media funnels, then you are going to leverage the different platforms on social media like YouTube-like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. You have to increase your followers on these platforms and you have to increase your subscribers and for that, you have to post content, now gromo gives you most of the free content for them, especially for Instagram, now when you per content regularly and its engagement increase and you also get followers due to algorithm, and the second thing that you can also create your videos on Instagram and YouTube and Facebook. When you will create and put your videos and you will put content then you will get new people regularly and when you get these new people then it will come in two categories which we understood in starting, either these people also want extra income or these people are interested in some product or some service, then you can approach those people for extra income or for some service, which will keep coming to your income regularly. Right now I have talked in short because people now have more curiosity to know about to the point You are going to get many courses and webinars in the Gromo, but what I  have told you, in short, is a platform in which you can earn money by promoting financial services The link is in the description and comment box, sign up today and many exciting offers are going on, as I showed you.

Now you have understood that you are going to earn money on different financial products. Now let us understand what are the ways to bring leads. First of all, you should make a list of warm markets. Now How does this warm market list start? Let me explain to you. What is this warm market and what is this cold market? These are the common words in the sale. You pick up your phonebook and see, you need a side income. Many people want side income and there will be many people who want financial products. So you make a list of two people, one of those who need extra earnings or those who need extra income, then one is a category of extra income, you can put name 1,2,3 here and after that, you can create another category, those who need the products and services, then you can make a list of them and after that, you can call your friends to step by step and you can tell them on call or you can tell them about gromo on WhatsApp. Now that you have made and you have worked on it, then let's assume that you have made a list of 100 people and out of 100 you have 20, 30, and 40 people associated with you. Now definitely you will get some earnings from them but you will say that this earning is limited, and it can also stop after some time because people are limited. Now, this was about the market, now let's also understand the cold market. Now the cold market means that the people you don't know, there were People in the warm market whom you know, you recommended them one time, the thing is money has come. But now we need money continuously and for that, you made a funnel on social media, now what does it mean. Let me explain to you when we talk about social media funnels, then you are going to leverage the different platforms on social media like YouTube-like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. You have to increase your followers on these platforms and you have to increase your subscribers and for that, you have to post content, now gromo gives you most of the free content for them, especially for Instagram, now when you per content regularly and its engagement increase and you also get followers due to algorithm, and the second thing that you can also create your videos on Instagram and YouTube and Facebook. When you will create and put your videos and you will put content then you will get new people regularly and when you get these new people then it will come in two categories which we understood in starting, either these people also want extra income or these people are interested in some product or some service, then you can approach those people for extra income or for some service, which will keep coming to your income regularly. Right now I have talked in short because people now have more curiosity to know about to the point You are going to get many courses and webinars in the Gromo, but what I  have told you, in short, is a platform in which you can earn money by promoting financial services The link is in the description and comment box, sign up today and many exciting offers are going on, as I showed you.

5,Misleading,"So hello everyone, welcome back to our channel. Well, today's  video is going to be very exciting  for you all because you want your money to grow. Your money should  grow and you should  get maximum returns on your money. Now there are many people  who look for ways how they  will get maximum returns on their money. Today in this video,  I am going to tell you step  by step. In fact, I am going to show you. I will also show you  that what returns are  being produced on the money I have invested, how are they happening  and how will you get  returns. So watch the video till the end. If you like it, then  share this video and  if you have not subscribed, then do it. Now see we are talking  about 13% returns. Now  how does it work? There will be a lot of new people. Let me explain  the concept a little  bit. You know about the rule of 72. I am assuming that. The rule  of 72 is a very simple  rule that says how much time your money will double. You will  find out like this.  Take 13 here. I have written 13. For example, you are getting  12% returns on your money.  So whatever return you are getting, you will divide it by 72.  So if you divide 72 by 12,  then the answer will be 6. That means your money will double  in 6 years. Now if you have  1 crore, then 1 crore will become 2 crores. If you have 1 lakh,  then 1 lakh will become  2 lakh. If you have 10,000, then 10,000 will become 20,000. Depending  on how much capital  you want to answer in the comments, if I divide 72 by 13, then  what answer will come?  How much time will the money double? You have to answer in the  comments. Now if we understand  this multiplication game, then it is not just about 6 years.  For example, we are talking  about 1 to 2. In 6 years, 1 lakh will become 2 lakhs, 1 crore  will become 2 crores or  10 lakhs will become 20 lakhs. This will happen in 6 years. But  in the next 6 years,  what will happen to 2? 4 will be 4, 8 will be 8 and 16 will be  16. The cycle of reaching  1 to 16 is the same, but you have to start later. Now what is  the concept? How does  your money multiply? First I show you what investment I have  made, how I am getting  a 13% return and how you will also get a return of almost 13%.  So I show you my phone first  and I turn on the screen recording so that you can see exactly  what I want to show you.  So we have simply come to MobiQ. I hope many people use MobiQ.  If not, then it is okay.  Here you will see an extra feature. On this extra you are seeing  that my 10 lakhs, 7000,  500 something rupees, you are seeing my value. I have turned  on interest of 7000 something.  Now I am getting money according to 12%. If I want to withdraw  it, then see the withdraw  button will come here. If I want to withdraw this, then I want  to do the example full amount,  if I want to withdraw, then I can do the full amount. If I want  only 7500, then I will  withdraw it. This is a very simple process. How is this 12% getting?  I will tell you now.  What is more important than this? I am getting this. My wife  is getting 13%, almost 13%.  So I show you how. This was my phone, I have turned off the screen  recording. Now I take  you to my wife's phone. So I turn on the screen recording. I  have entered the password.  Now let's use the wife's phone less. So I have come here again  extra. Now if you look  here, then my wife's interest is 10,000 on 10 lakhs. Now why  is this interest more?  I will tell you, we had put money at almost the same time. So  it can be something in the  future, I do not remember exactly. So here you will see that  12.99% per annum is getting.  I am getting 12%, here it is getting almost 13%. Why is it getting?  I will give you the  answer. How is it getting? I will give you the answer. And here  now if I want to withdraw  the money, then we will click here on 10 lakh rupees. Now see  if I withdraw, then what  is the wonder here that the interest I have got, it will be only  according to 8%. Now  why is it that it is showing here and I am getting 8, now many  of your questions will  come. So now I will give you the answer to those questions, understand  that. So now  we are not withdrawing it. Let it be, let the money be compounded.  Let it be on work.  Basically, if you do not get interest on interest, then you will  have to take care.  There is compound interest, there is no compound interest. What  is simple interest? This formula  that we were showing, this formula is basically on compound interest  that the interest will  also be reinvested. There is an option in this, I will explain  that to you. So you will have  to understand everything. Now first of all you saw that I had  invested 10 lakh rupees  and I am getting a return of 12% on it. So what is this, why  is the return coming? How  is it coming? You will have to understand. So here there is peer-to-peer  lending. Now  this peer-to-peer lending is done by many NBFCs, there are RBI  registered NBFCs, so peer-to-peer  lending is done through them. Now my 10 lakh rupees have not  gone to one person. This money  has gone to many people on loan. So for example, this money would  have given 5000 rupees to  many people, it would have given 1000 rupees to someone, so the  risk is very low that your  money will be lost or there will be no returns on money. Suppose  someone has defaulted,  there is a default probability. Suppose someone has defaulted,  then it will be a default of  10 lakh rupees, but if other people are giving interest, then  almost a stagnant interest  is kept getting. We have already talked about this on peer-to-peer  lending and it is comparatively  safe because I have been using it for a long time. So the return  on money is getting 12%  according to me. You check, by the way, no comparison should  be done, but if you check  elsewhere, then if there is money in your bank or you put it  somewhere else, then the  return of 12% does not come. So the return of 12% is a very good  return. The biggest  thing is that you do not have a lock-in period here if you invest  according to 12%, but in  my wife, what you saw, it is 13%, it is showing 12.99%, but when  I am going to withdraw money,  then why is it coming out according to 8% because there is a  lock-in period here. Here you will  have to see that the lock-in period that is coming in it, if  you withdraw money before  that, then you are getting it according to 8%, but if you do  not need money immediately,  like I do not need immediate, I have put money in my wife's account,  I have put it in the  extra, this is extra plus, so this was extra, this is extra plus,  I will write, this is the  extra feature of them, this is extra plus, so what is the benefit  of extra plus, that  here according to 12.99%, but there is a lock-in in it, if you  do not need immediate money,  then you can put it in it, but if you need immediate money, then  I tried both. The most  important thing is that if I am telling anything to my users,  then the most important thing  is that I have tried it myself and it is amazing that there is  no paid promotion, I liked it,  so I am sharing it with you that there are such platforms in  the market that are providing  you interest according to 12.99% and if your money is increasing,  then you should try it  because I am trying this, so I take you back to my phone where  I am getting 12%, so this  option gives and I explain to you what is its lock-in period,  so that you can see exactly,  the lock-in period is 3 months, so here the minimum lock-in period  is 3 months, no deposit  fees are charged and you can earn up to 12.99% per annum, so  here I took interest according  to 12% according to extra and I also showed you here according  to extra plus from wife  that how you get more money, now many people will say that I  have invested 10 lakh rupees,  you can invest 1000, 5000, 10,000, totally up to you, it is not  that I have to give you  any interest, it is your own money, I want to tell you that for  example, your salary  comes, it may be 30,000 rupees, now if you keep it with you,  it will not increase much,  you do not need it immediately, you have invested money and you  have started getting some interest  in it, now what I told you, like this is extra, it has simple  interest, so you can take out  whatever interest you are getting, you can withdraw it daily  from here, whatever interest  you are getting, now daily interest is being withdrawn, there  is nothing better than this,  you can understand this instrument and if you like it, then you  can share this video,  if you want to invest on MobiQ, I will provide the link in the  description and comment box,  you can go directly and take advantage of the extra and extra  plus feature and as I said  there is no minimum in it, so you can invest the amount you want  and see, first if you  want, if you are building less trust on it, then you read it  first, you can see terms  and conditions in it, you can see facts in it, frequently answered  questions, so if you  have any questions, you will get answers to them, go and check  out, if you feel it is  right, then only invest, there is nothing in it that I have to  tell you and you have to  invest, so this is the thing that I am investing myself, so I  told you, I will give you the  link in the description and comment box of this feature, extra  and extra plus, finally  I will see you in the next video, if you like the video, then  like it and subscribe if  you haven't done it yet, I will see you in the next video, till  the time you go self-made  and Jai Hind.

6,Misleading,"Have you ever thought about what these extreme rich people, 

millionaires, 

actually do? 

A rich man changes his clothes in 15 minutes, 

changes his house in 30 minutes, 

changes his business in an hour, 

and changes his wife in 2 hours. 

Honestly, they do nothing. 

But maybe, 

this is the secret to making money. 

Doing nothing. 

Listen, I have a scheme of rich people, 

using which I earned around Rs. 30,000 in a week. 

How? 

By doing nothing. 

Actually, by doing nothing. 

So, this story starts by asking some of my rich friends, 

how they earned money. 

Hey, hey, sir, what do you do that you have such a nice car? 

I'm a Baniya. I got it as dowry. 

Oh, that's fine. When is the next video coming? 

Hey, sir, Yash, Yash. 

Sir, sir, sir. 

Sir, what do you do that you have such a nice car? 

I lent money to my friend, 

and he didn't give it, so I kept his car. 

Sir, are you from Haryana? 

Yes. 

Good job, sir. 

Sir, what do you do that you have such a nice car? 

I have a lot of YouTube channels. 

What are you saying? Really? 

But in a week, I couldn't convince a rich girl, 

become the don of the city, 

or even open a YouTube channel. 

I needed to find something else. 

So, I went on YouTube and searched 

how to earn money by doing nothing. 

And after watching almost all the videos on this topic, 

and after getting away from the scams, 

I think we have found our way. 

Yes, sir, do you want us to edit the video? 

Sir, 3000. 

Okay, sir, done. 

Bro, I want a video edited. 

1000 rupees. 

ok, done. 

So, basically, brokering. 

Bro, I mean, I'm becoming a middleman, 

connecting two people. 

It's called drop servicing. 

brokering! 

brokering. 

So, at this point, I needed two types of people. 

One, people who work ie. freelancers. 

And the other, who want to get their work done. 

Clients. 

And I needed both of them. 

So, I'm going to give these two jobs to someone else. 

Thankfully, I know someone. 

Right? 

Right? 

Okay, guys. 

Today is Sunday, 26th March, 2023. 

By next Monday, our plan will be 

to start making money online using drop servicing. 

In case you don't know, I'm Akhil from Paisa Waisa. 

And I've been doing this for many years. 

Now, because I have a little expertise in cold email strategy, 

I've done it many times, I've been successful. 

That's why I'm going to use the same strategy for this video. 

Now, on one hand, Akhil was busy with 

getting the potential clients' emails. 

On the other hand, I thought, 

let's chill a little. 

Now, because I didn't want to do any work, 

I was just watching the views. 

But Akhil was still working. 

Here, I was enjoying this beautiful hotel. 

And there, Akhil was trying to get us 

clients from outside. 

So that we can charge in dollars 

and make more money. 

So guys, today is 3rd April. 

And I've come back from my trip. 

And it's been a week since Akhil started sending 

emails 

So, Akhil has sent roughly 266 emails. 

Out of which, 119 were for video editing. 

And 157 were for writing. 

And out of these, we got a total of 5 clients. 

Now, how much money I made from these 5 clients, 

you'll find out at the end of this video. 

But for now, let's do all this work. 

Or rather, let's get it done. 

Because I'm not going to do it. 

Now, look, I have a lot of video editors. 

But I don't have content writers. 

So, I put up a story for a list of content writers. 

But I'm not going to talk to these video editors 

and content writers. 

So, I paid my cameraman to actually talk to them. 

Get the work done. 

And now, you handle it. 

We'll talk in a week. 

Done. 

Let's see you in a week. 

Now, while all this work is happening, 

I'll do a few things with you. 

A lot of you must be interested to try this yourself. 

So, if you want the email that we used, 

which Akhil used, for the content writers, 

here it is. 

And a similar email that we used for video editors, 

here it is. 

I won't tell you to copy and use it. 

But you can use something similar. 

Now, if you're having a problem 

with where to get people's emails, 

you can get it from LinkedIn. 

You can get it from the About section of YouTube. 

You can get it from Instagram. 

But if you want to find the best way 

to find people's emails, Akhil has made a video on it. 

I'll put it in the description 

as to how you can find someone's email. 

Lastly, I'd also like to say that 

out of all the emails we sent, 

our priority was to find people from outside. 

So that we could charge a little more 

and we could have more profit in the conversion. 

That's why most of the clients we were targeting 

were Indians as well. 

But the majority were from outside. 

Now, let's see the scene after a week. 

So guys, today is 10th April, 2023. 

And finally, it's almost a month now. 

This video is coming to an end now. 

This took way longer than it should have. 

Just a while ago, we got our last email 

which was a work email. 

So finally, all the money has come. 

All the work is done. 

And finally, I can tell you 

how much money we have earned by doing nothing. 

Now, as I said earlier, 

we got a total of 5 clients. 

Out of which, 3 people were for content writing, 

basically blogs and articles. 

And 2 people were for video editing. 

So if we talk about writing work, 

we earned $15, $25 and $20 respectively. 

Which is about $60. 

Or in Indian currency, it's about Rs.4,900. 

Now, if I talk about video editing work, 

the first client wanted us to edit a 15-minute video 

and for that, we charged $150. 

And the second client wanted shorts from us. 

We negotiated and said $40 per shot. 

But after finalizing, 

we got a deal of 5 shorts for $120. 

So basically, we earned $330 without doing anything. 

Which if you convert it according to today, 

is roughly Rs.27,000. 

But the story doesn't end here 

because we have to deduct some money. 

Now, because all our clients were from the US, 

we took all the payments in PayPal. 

And PayPal charges its own fees, 

which in this case was about Rs.1,100. 

After cutting it, if we round off, 

we have Rs.26,000 left. 

Now, because this video couldn't have been made without Akhil, 

and it took his time, skills, and expertise, 

and I didn't do anything, 

we had already decided that 

out of all the money that we would make, 

40% of it would be his share. 

So, 40% of Rs.26,000 is Rs.10,400. 

Which leaves us with... 

Let me calculate. 

Rs.15,600. 

Now, let's cut the money that I paid the freelancers. 

Remember, for this work, 

I hired only one video editor and one content writer 

to do all the work because the work wasn't much. 

Now, I paid my content writers Rs.500 per article, 

which is Rs.1,500. 

Which now comes to a total of Rs.14,100. 

The money is going down pretty fast. 

Now, as far as the video editor is concerned, 

I paid him Rs.1,500 for the long video. 

For the 5 shorts, I paid Rs.1,500 at Rs.300 per short. 

So, in total, I paid Rs.3,000 to the video editor. 

Which brings our total to Rs.11,100. 

And this is the amount that I earned, 

which is my profit without doing anything. 

But wait, because I didn't do any work myself, 

I promised my cameraman 

that I will pay him to coordinate with the editors 

and get all the work done. 

So, I paid him Rs.2,000, 

which now brings our total profit to Rs.9,100. 

Now, on one hand, this way of earning money 

looks very fun and unique in this video. 

But actually, this is how a lot of millionaires 

and billionaires earn their money. 

They get people to work for a low price, 

exploit them, and keep all the profit themselves. 

I don't want to do this. 

I paid my freelancers roughly Rs.4,500. 

I am going to double their earning 

so that it is fair for them as well. 

And I have Rs.4,600 left. 

Now, considering that I did almost nothing, 

Rs.4,600 is also basically free money 

and a very good amount. 

But if you want to do this, you can do it too. 

Just keep the margins low and do some work yourself. 

Because if you do nothing, you will earn nothing.

7,Misleading,"Well, I don't know what your favourite subject is but my favourite subject is to earn money and multiply money well since we started this series on financial education. You guys have become proactive, you guys are asking questions. What you guys are asking in the comment, it seems that you are interested in financial education. You guys want to learn more. So in this video. I am going to teach you something by which you have understood compounding. You understand how powerful compounding is. Today I will tell you how you can use that compounding with double speed to multiply money and I will be very interested and what I will tell you, you have to apply, but whatever you are learning in financial education. This all is a practical application, the people who are applying this, they are becoming rich and they will become a real millionaire in life, and you will not follow this, they will remain the same, so the choice is yours, but what I am about to tell you, you will understand it very carefully. See, the first concept I will discuss, it is not so good for us and our economy. This is the truth and what I am about to share with you. It's not good for our economy, so I feel a little bad to say that. But you need to know as an investor, it can be your benefit as an investor. And you can use it in your favour, it is going against the whole of India. As an investor, you can use it in your favour. Let's understand what it is. First of all, I'm going to talk about the concept that our Indian rupee, we will compare it with dollar you will understand the first concept, then you will get to know about the second concept that how the money will multiply fast with Double Speed. So when we are talking about rupees and we are comparing it with dollars then look 10 years ago today, there is all the data available on Google. 10 years ago, what we are talking about today, the value of about $1 was around ₹ 45. So the ₹45 value, today it is around ₹ 75. You see, the increment that has happened here is 65%. Now keep this concept in mind which I am telling this now. There was an increment of 65% in the value, the dollar increased and the rupee broke down. Now, this is not good for India. But you can use it in your favour, and I will tell you. So you have understood this concept that we are seeing what is going on for the last 10 years Now let us understand the second concept. We were talking about compounding. Now in compounding, we understand that if you get returns on your investments of 12 per cent and 14 per cent and of 15 per cent, then it can be amazing. When you use it in your favour, then your ten thousand can become ten lakh. You understood this compounding, you understood that if we talk about Nifty, what is Nifty and what is Sensex, you already know and I will give a brief to you. I am going to talk about compounding also, but what I am telling you about compounding is that the return you get of 12%, 14%. It can convert ten thousand to ten lakh over the period. Then Nifty has given you annual compounded returns of 12% to 14%, but there is something called Nasdaq, have you heard its name, now why I am talking about Nasdaq, why I'm talking about the S&P 500. Why are we talking about this today? I will tell you this. Right now we keep things short and simplified so that you understand everything step by step What is Nifty, You Already Know that If I talk about Nifty Fifty, then the top Fifty company which is listed on NSE, which are listed on the national stock exchange, whose index is formed which shows that the market is going up and going down, we call it nifty, then it is of India. The top thirty companies come in the Sensex, which is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, top 30 companies, then they are the Indian companies. You have seen that they have given returns of up to 15 per cent. NASDAQ also gave returns of over 14% over the last 10 years, but the amazing thing I will tell you. Understand this carefully, When we listen to something carefully, bring your ears forward because now something is important. Returns of 14% and returns of 14% from Nifty are not equal. Why not equal, because 10 years ago the dollar was worth ₹45, now it's worth ₹75. If this is increased by 65%, then the investment of the people also increases by 65%. There is compounding going on here, so the returns cannot be equal here. You can't compare it but now it's a sad thing that most of the people inside India do not know that they can invest in US stocks. Now let me explain to you these US stocks, Nasdaq. If we talk about the NASDAQ 100, then it is an index that is telling that Nasdaq is an index inside the US stock of Hundred Company. You talk about Google about Amazon and you talk about Facebook, you talk about Tesla and Apple. NASDAQ is made up of these companies. S&P 500 consists of 500 companies that are listed on the US Stock Market, Adobe is included You've heard of Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway. You have to invest in it. You have to invest in Bank of America. These companies come in, It does not work according to India. The company which is listed in Sensex inside India is also listed in Nifty. But it's different here that companies that are listed on NASDAQ are not listed on S&P 500, so it is different, So now the question is that today we will see the rupee depreciating, it is Falling and the dollar increasing. The rupee is Falling and the dollar is Falling, and in the coming time it will continue for some time, then it is bad for India. But it is a good thing for us as an investor because we can invest our money in US stocks. If we buy today according to the dollar, then the rate of the dollar will increase, we will get benefits, this is the first thing. Second thing is that the price of the stock will also increase. Today we are talking about Facebook and Google and you are talking about Tesla and Apple, you are talking about the companies that have created havoc. And today we are talking about investment in that company. There are two ways you can do this. I will explain both the ways and I am going to show you something on my mobile screen also, then keep the phone for 1 minute. Let me explain your concept first. There are two things, you can do direct investment in the stocks that you can buy stocks directly, but you do not know which stocks to invest in. Then we have told you that you can also choose passive mutual funds, mutual funds are for those who don't want to use much brain and appoint fund manager and he is investing money on your behalf. But when you invest money in passive fund's. Then understand what happens inside passive funds that the money you are investing in passive mutual funds, that is directly investing in NASDAQ 100 and it is directly investing in the S&P 500, then the companies which come into the Nasdaq 100, You know that even keep changing times, so you should not even think about it and fund manager also don't need to think about it, your money will keep investing according to NASDAQ and I have told you about NASDAQ returns that they are above approximately 14%, from last 10 years. So the dollar is appreciated again, so the people here have got tremendous returns from those who would have invested in NASDAQ and especially in NASDAQ passive funds. Now when I talk about passive mutual funds. So, I would like to show you my investments, you will enjoy them too. I will show you how it goes, so here I take you to my mobile phone screen. There is a finity app here. I'll show you that from the start. When you come to infinity, I Need to restart the Internet. Alright, as soon as you come to the homepage of finity. You will see passive index funds here. So I told you that NASDAQ is an Index S&P 500 is an Index, similarly Nifty is an Index. Sensex is an index, so when you go to a passive Index fund, you need passive because a lot of charges are taken inactive. That too we are going to see here, so they have also told the basics for you, so now they are Sensex Backers, Nifty Backers. Now we're talking about the global indices, so the NASDAQ 100 is a global index, then come on global indices, so now you will come on global indices, then you will see here Is a mutual fund of Motilal Oswal. You have an investment in S&P 500, here there is fund direct growth inside NASDAQ. Now see two things here which are important to know, one is the expense ratio and the second is tracking error, one thing is necessary that there should be at least expense ratio in the fund you are investing money, then your expenses are minimized when you are investing in the mutual fund, the fund manager is working for you but here your money is investing but here from your actively mutual fund, it is taking very less money in which there is less tracking error, you invest in it. So here you can see a tracking error of 4.96% and tracking error means as the companies are changing in Nasdaq 100, then the money is invested according to that. So here there is a fund direct growth plan in Kotak NASDAQ, so you can invest in it, it has an expense ratio of 0.27%, everything is mentioned in front of you. Now I said that first of all let me show you my investment. Here I am in my portfolio, I have invested in my portfolio sometime back, so I show my existing SIP. This is Motilal Oswal Nasdaq100, so I was talking about Nasdaq 100, then I have started an investment of 50000 in Nasdaq 100. So I have started with 50000, I do not say that you also start with 50000. You can start at ₹500 or 5000 it doesn't make a difference. It makes a difference in compounding. I have told you that if you let the money compound today, then the result is going to come in front of you. Let me talk about myself. I invest ₹ 50000 in SIP every month. I had taken an example before but let's think that I leave it today and let it compound for not more than 50 years for our children and we assume that we are getting annual returns of 14%. First of all, you will comment on how this money will become after 50 years with the compounding of 14%. Now whatever amount will come, you will keep one thing in mind as it has increased by 65% ​​in the last 10 years. What will the dollar be worth in the next 50 years? Keep this in mind too and then think how much this money will be. Your senses will be blown away. Because, today when I started this video, I told you that I will tell you something special, so that you take compounding from double speed, then it is a double-speed thing. Very few people understand this, not everyone understands, but the one who understands is earning money. This is what I showed you that it is a small investment. I invest a lot but I am investing because I know that these investments will make a real edge. It is a small investment. Meaning investing ₹ 50000 per month is not a big deal for me. I have invested 75000 SIP on finite. It is not a Big deal, the big deal is I am investing, the big deal is I am only 26, the big deal is that what I am doing today, will be best in the future. Meaning, if you want to reach the rest of rupees and thousands of crores of rupees, then you must know all these things. Very few people know that so I am telling you. I have invested infinite, and you can also use it in your favour. I will put the link to finite in the description and the comment box. You can follow simple steps and can open your account on finite, and you can start your SIP, this is a good habit. If your SIP is 200, 2000, 2lac rupees, it doesn't matter. It makes a difference by having a good habit, investing money is a good habit. And what you think, you can comment below.

8,Misleading,"is there anything i can buy here that

will actually make me money

i don't know like maybe i could buy this

gluten-free instant oatmeal crap and try

to resell it and make money

well today i am going to share with you

five different 10 investments

that you can use to make your money back

that anyone

can do

[Music]

one shot now the future

i'm turning dreams into reality yeah

should become endlessly fascinated with

what makes people rich

and makes people poor and yes you my

friend

today we're talking about investing

that's what this channel is all about

even if it means you're investing

something as small as a 10

bill i'm just a bill yes i'm only a bill

oh chris that is such a small amount of

money could i really invest that

seriously

well if you're serious about making

money yes today's video

is for you i did not come from a rich

family

i didn't come from a poor family i came

from a middle class

struggling family and you know what

middle class really does mean

poor because the middle class and

technically poor people do something

very very different than the wealthy for

example

most people meaning the middle class and

poor people

they like to work hard for the money and

then at the end of the day they

go buy stuff this is stuff

look it's just stuff

if they're not buying stuff like switch

and french fries and

gear they're buying liabilities like oh

i'm gonna pay every month for my phone

and

from my netflix and i got to pay for my

credit cards and i got to cover my rent

and this will keep you locked in a cycle

and there's only one way to break the

cycle

you have to be able to learn how to

invest and i know what you're thinking

chris i will invest if i have a lot of

money when i finally work hard enough

and i save money

i'll invest that listen up you are

becoming

right now in this moment a person based

on today's choices

which means that if you're not investing

today then you're not becoming someone

who will invest tomorrow

when i was in college and i got my first

full-time job and i saw how

little money i made that is when i

became aware

that the choices i was going to start

making right then and there

were either going to make me

middle-class poor or they were going to

make me rich

and you know there's something that

wealthy or even financially well-to-do

people do you know what it is

they invest they buy things that make

the money for example here's the

definition of investment

an investment is an asset by the way not

a liability something that costs you

money

or item acquired with the goal of

generating income

or appreciating appreciating means i buy

it and then with time

it becomes more valuable or if i buy it

on a regular basis it actually gives me

something back it gives me money in time

it actually pays for itself

and so at the end of the day rich people

work hard

to invest their money and have it make

the money poor people work hard

to just blow it on consumables and

things that don't make them anything

i learned at a really young age that

even when i was po

because i couldn't afford the o and the

r i still had

a little bit of money and i could invest

it and i could turn it into something

which is why today i want to show you

different investments on how you can

take a 10 bill something really small

and actually turn it into something

because

i think the habit and the pattern will

get you to think a different way wire

you a different way

and it only becomes a small matter of

time before small investments

become big investments you know

technically an asset really is something

that you buy once

but then it continues to make you money

it pays for itself over and over again

like

a vending machine

did you know that every time you drop a

buck in there someone probably bought

that soda can for like

30 cents they're making 70 cents on that

or

there's people that buy things like i

like real estate those are obviously

really big investments

but they sometimes don't require a lot

of money and if you're intelligent

sometimes they don't require you any

like five thousand dollars

made me my first 1.6 million dollars

because

i wanted to invest in a bigger game of

course you've got storefronts there's

businesses so today there's a lot of

things that you could be investing in

let's talk about five stupid simple

things that you could do

with 10 bucks while some investments

require like a lot of money there are

some that just don't require a whole lot

and one of those cryptocurrency now

there's a lot of cryptocurrencies out

there i know you've heard about it

but the most famous one is bitcoin and

did you know that even though a bitcoin

might sell for 10 000 or

38 000 or whatever the price is right

now

you can buy a piece of a bitcoin you

could buy 10

of a bitcoin and you know what this

investment

is highly speculative um you shouldn't

put

all of your money into cryptocurrency

but a lot of people believe that

cryptocurrency eventually

is the future and as a result we've seen

that bitcoin price

skyrocket this year shows a comparison

of like

what's happened to the value of gold

over time like i don't invest in any

gold because it just

doesn't go anywhere the stock market the

s p 500 right

that goes up with time bitcoin's been

highly volatile

but guess what for people that got in

early they've been making a ton of money

you know chris speaking of stocks what

about investing

in stocks doesn't that require a lot of

money

not necessarily right now us news and

the world report came out with nine of

the best cheap stocks to buy for

literally

under ten dollars cirrus xm adt nokia

like take a screenshot

xenia ambev however you say some of

these things

these are stocks that are going places

and the good news is they don't require

a lot of money

in fact 10 bucks today everybody's

telling you you need a website i need a

website i need a website you can't do

anything

without a website but you know what if

you want a website you need

a domain name and you know what they

cost a little bit of money you can go

onto

godaddy.com or one of the other hosting

sites and you can search

for a website and did you know that you

can buy a domain for sometimes as little

as 10 bucks and here's the thing yeah

you could use the website and do

something with it

but a lot of people just buy websites

and they hold on to them

and allow them to go up in value i had

started this company called

uplife but i didn't own uplife.com

and someone was selling it for three

thousand dollars and you know what

if i could just have lived with a

different website name i could have

gotten a free website for like

10 bucks if you will but no i spent 3


and i bought uplife.com the business did

not do well

so i decided to sell it for six thousand

dollars

but a year later i wanted the website

back again and i paid twelve thousand

dollars for it

dude there are some people that

literally i got a buddy he just goes and

buys up all these domains that he thinks

are popular and in time

someone's gonna want them they're good

simple trendy types of titles

and you know what all the dot coms are

pretty much used up but not

usa or dot net or dot what the heck ever

and so

people will spend 10 bucks they'll buy a

website and eventually

someone might come knocking like me and

say hey

can i buy that for a lot more money than

you paid

listen man at this point if you're still

watching the video you're thinking okay

okay when i get money i gotta stop

putting it towards my bills

i gotta put it to work chris says that

if i put enough money to work

someday i don't need to like literally

it will work for me

and i'm telling you right now that's how

i retired at the age of 26

some people they subscribe to this

channel because they're like wow chris

will teach you about

real estate investment take out the word

real estate keep the word

investment ultimately i buy and sell

businesses i buy and sell real estate

i love buying things that give me a

return something as simple as

worthy bonds i'm still worthy did you

know that there's this new site out

there and you can buy little bits and

pieces of

small businesses and essentially pick up

a five percent return on your money

you check this out it's a peer-to-peer

investment site where investors make

loans to small businesses in increments

of just 10 bucks

which by the way is the minimum

investment and the bonds pay a return

of 5 on your money now before i share

the fifth and final investment of what

you can do with

10 bucks i want you to know that i've

held out for a bonus at the end

i'm gonna share with you currently one

of my favorite investments that takes a

little bit more money

but it is insane how much money it makes

you

before i share that check this out we're

talking about number five

education yeah something as simple as

like

getting a book like often people will

watch my videos and then i give my books

away for free but they gotta cover the

shipping and handling so they

you know throw down seven or eight

dollars and i want to ask you a question

if you had a chance for example to buy a

book on making money no matter what it's

about

that someone has dedicated their entire

life to learning about

and mastering and you can acquire all

that knowledge for as little as 10 bucks

that's what i call a bargain in fact the

first several

million dollars that i made i can tie

directly

to books that i read like napoleon

hill's think and grow rich

robert kiyosaki's rich dad poor dad

millionaire next door

the biology of belief man there's so

many books out there that have

contributed

to me becoming the person that i am

today i want to advise

that you consider in your life reading

at least one

or two books every single month take a

person's life's work

and consume it in a matter of hours

because guess what

i feel like that's one of the coolest

hacks for

sucking the best knowledge out of

someone's brain and if you read

one little book and it gives you a

million dollar idea or even a hundred

dollar idea

100 ideas like a 10 times return on the

money that you invested in the stupid

book

like this is how anyone becomes wealthy

they start with something small

like 10 bucks and then you invest it and

you learn how to turn it into a hundred

dollars

and then one of two things gonna happen

you're either gonna say hey

i'm gonna go spend that hundred dollars

on something that'll never make me money

or

i'm gonna do it again i'm gonna take

that hundred dollars and i'm gonna learn

how to turn that

into a thousand dollars and if you can

take that and turn into a thousand

dollars

then ten thousand dollars and then you

turn into a hundred thousand dollars

before you know it you've made a million

dollars like one of the richest

individuals in the world bill gates the

guy dropped out of harvard

ultimately you want to take a small

amount of money and roll it forward

so that you can do something a little

bit more serious like start a small

business

i have found 50 different businesses

that i can start for

literally less than a thousand dollars

and these things can produce a thousand

dollars

every single week but a business

sometimes requires a little bit of work

a little bit of elbow grease so if you

do nothing with the business you'd make

nothing

but i also have other people that are

making thousands of dollars

9,Misleading,"Well, you must be surprised to read that when I wrote that where  to invest useless money,  how can you earn extra money with your extra money. Well, how  did I get the idea of this?  A friend of mine calls me and says, Pushkar, give some advice.  I have some useless money  lying around and I have to invest it. Where should I invest it?  When I was guiding him,  I thought that it is not only with my friend. There are many  people who have some spare  money, who want to invest, but they do not know where to invest.  Now you guys make a  mistake and you can't increase the money that much. So it is  my duty that as much as  I was able to guide my friend with my intelligence, I will tell  you that much today. And if you  like it, then just share this video because I am actually going  to talk about your work  because you may have spare money today. Maybe you will have spare  money tomorrow.  So money is always lying with us at some point and we want to  grow that money. So if we  want to learn to grow money in the next video, well, I told you  three things in financial  education. Earning money, managing money and increasing money,  growing money. So if  you want to grow money, this video is actually for you and if  you have not subscribed yet,  if you have not clicked on the bell icon, then do it now. It  is free to subscribe and  if you click on the bell icon, you will be updated. You will  get the update of our next  video. Now let's start. If you have extra money, then where can  you invest it? All people  want to know where to invest in the stock market. Where to invest  in the share market,  which share to buy. This happens in the minds of many people.  If you have extra money, then  put it in the share market. I will give you a genuine advice.  It has just started from  the video that if your time horizon is less than 3 years and  you do not want to learn  much. If you want to learn, then you can earn good money in less  than 3 years by investing.  We are not talking about trading now. By investing, but if you  have less time and you do not want  to learn much, then you will have to give the stock market at  least 3 years if you want  to put money in it. So if your time horizon is less than 3 years,  then do not look at  the stock market. I will tell you when to see and what you have  to see in it. I will  just tell you, but if the horizon is less than 3 years, do not  think about the stock  market in the starting. Now what happens is that if my horizon  is less than 3 years, then  what will be the reason for it. The reason will be that if a  person needs money before  3 years, then there may be short-term needs. In short term, there  may be some needs. Now  what can those needs be? It is possible that he has extra money  today, but he is saving  it. He has to buy a new car. It is possible that a person has  to get married at home.  He has money for it today and he wants that money to increase  a little more. It is possible  that there can be many more needs. Anyone can have any need.  So if you need money before  3 years and you understand this, you put money in the stock market  on someone's request.  Now I do not know if you put it in a mutual fund or in stocks  and assume that when you  put money, because most of the people do this, that when they  put money, they see a  negative return. We thought that the money will increase and  the money did not increase,  but it decreased. If this has ever happened to you, then do tell  us by commenting. Now  here our question is that if this happens, then if you need it  in the short term, then  the money was less. We wanted to increase, increase with less  risk and if it decreases,  then the pressure will increase on us. That is why I am suggesting  to you that you do  not want to give time in the horizon of less than 3 years. If  you do not understand, then  stay away from the stock market. It is not for you now. Then  what is for you? Now you  understand my point very carefully. I guided you like I guided  my friend. I do not understand  any difference between you and my friend. You are also my friend.  So I will just tell  you exactly what I do. How do I keep myself diversified? What  is going on from where?  I will tell you that. So if my own time horizon is less, then  there should be liquidity in  my hand. Money should also be in my hand. Whenever we want, we  get money. It should  not be that I put money in such an instrument that there is a  lock-in. I put money in lock-in,  it means I can't even withdraw money. So now I will get stuck.  So what I can do to make  some extra money, I will just tell you. See, it is like you have  to understand something.  What will you have to understand? If you need money in the short  term and you want to grow,  so there is one thing which you can do and that is lending. You  can give money on interest.  Now you must have heard suddenly, sir, give money on interest.  How bad the world is these  days. The world is bad. You have given it to a friend on interest.  You thought that  the money will increase. On the contrary, he does not give money.  This happens many  times. So it is like this to make your work easy. See it is not  a paid promotion. I am  telling you first. There is no paid promotion. I have not taken  any money from anyone. I  will tell you what I will tell you from my heart. So see there  are multiple apps in my  phone. I will show you one by one. What I personally do and I  am telling you that I  have no motive to tell you anything. You can say that I am giving  you an advice. Rest,  you invest in your problem. So example, this is a 12% club. You  simply see, I have put  10 lakh rupees here because you cannot put more than 10 lakhs.  Now whatever interest  comes here, like 328 rupees has increased, so this 300 rupees,  I get interest for 28  lakhs. Means 12% per year, 1% per month is increasing on my money.  Till now I have got  an interest of 47000 rupees. So this is mine. This is my wife's,  this is my father's, this  is my mother's. So I have put some money of everyone, which is  liquid money because there  is a limit of 10 lakh rupees. Now it gives me money for daily  work and I can withdraw  the interest of daily work. This is not just once. I will show  you in this way. There  are multiple apps. You can use it. Example Unicard, so about  Unicard, it will be disabled.  I will not be able to put it. Screen recording is off. I will  turn off the screen recording  for you. Only then we can use this app. So what is here, if you  see, then my 9 lakh  rupees are invested here. I will give 9 lakh rupees because there  is a limit of 9 lakhs.  We cannot put more than this. So we will take a screenshot of  this. We will try to do something.  So here 9 lakh rupees has increased to 4000 rupees. This 4000  rupees that has increased,  you see this 4000 rupees is the return. Here it is getting according  to 9%. So in 12%  it is getting 9% like this. In the same way, you must have heard  that it is also on the  credit. There is a wait list on the credit. So I will show you  this too. Like Mint, so  here too you can earn around 9%. Around 9% you have this lending  rate here too. Now  what is this lending? I will tell you the concept. You are going  to invest a little money. In  the video, I will run very fast, so you will not understand what  you are doing. I will  tell you what happens. When you give money on these apps, then  the first thing is that  all these are trustworthy apps. I am not taking the name of any  such app. Like 12% club, so  if you have heard the name of Bharatpay, then it is a very big  company in the backup and  everything is happening under the guidelines of RBI. So what  happens is that when you  lend, where is this money going? You have to understand. This  money basically goes to NBFCs.  Money goes to non-banking financial corporations. So what does  non-banking mean? The company  is not a bank, but it comes in non-banking, in NBFC and it is  also registered. What happens  is that if you go to take a loan from the bank, you go to take  a home loan, you get  a home loan of 7-8-9%, but if you go to NBFC, who will go to  NBFC? If he comes to the bank,  he will be giving very less loan or not giving a loan. So what  do NBFCs do? They take a  little more risk and process the loan, but they take a lot of  rate of interest. You must  know that if you go to NBFC to take a loan, then they can charge  15%-16% anything. So  if any NBFC is taking 15-16% from the client, then they can give  you 12% because you have  given the money. Now you will say that if I gave it to a person  and it was defaulted  there, then you will have to study a little. So I tell you what  happens here. What happens  generally is that any company like this, which is providing you  a platform for lending,  then what they do, if you lend 100 rupees, then they do not give  100 rupees to a person.  What they will do is that they will give one rupee to 100 people.  So it is possible because  the rate of interest is very high, the risk profile is high.  You know that there is a  risk here, but if a person defaults, he will say that I will  not give, you can do my property  now, whatever you do, what will happen to that property, when  will it sell, whatever  it is, now the interest has stopped coming from one person. So  you can lose 1 rupee,  but 99 people are still giving you interest, so it is covered.  So here the risk is comparatively  very low. Risk is also in your bank account. You will remember  when Yes Bank had frozen  the withdrawal, then many people were suffocated. So there can  be a problem in the bank. Similarly,  the problem can be here too. My job is to guide you, but the  chances are very low.  So if you put an amount, for example, you put 10 lakhs, 9 lakhs  and I am telling you  that this is what I am also using, so this is not too bad. You  can use it. Now why am  I telling you, understand the example. If you want to invest  for 1 year, if you want  to invest for 2 years, then you will put money in any instrument.  Someone will convince you  a lot and say that take a mutual fund, take a bond, take a policy,  then you check, will  the return above 10% come in 1 year and what are the chances  that the return will come  above 10% and if the return above 10% does not come and I have  money in my app, I can  withdraw whenever I want. So this is a safe option comparatively.  It is not at all that  I am telling you this, I am not telling you to do FD. You can  also do FD. If you do FD,  you will get 7-8% and in 1 year no one will give 7-8%. So this  is being withdrawn every  day for example. So I am trying to tell you that if you invest  money in FD, then you can  invest in FD. Comparatively, it is also safe, but the rate of  interest is less in it. Where  you will get 6 in 1 year, here you will get 12 in 1 year. So  situation. My job is to guide. So one thing you can do for short  term. Now if your vision  comes, I have a horizon of 3 years. Now I have two questions  245 0:10:13,166 --> 0:10:04,112 you have to analyze yourself.  here that you have money  say that I can invest ₹ 5000  248 0:10:18,880 --> 0:10:17,093 every month to invest. Like people get their salary, so they  every month or sometimes what happens is that extra money is  already in the spare. Like  we talked about spare that sometimes 1 lakh, 2 lakh, 5 lakh,  10 lakh, anything is there  in the amount. This is in the spare. So here two things will  come. Now what I will suggest  to you number one, listen very carefully. These are actually  the things that I do myself  so that you can also benefit. You have to understand here that  there is something called  ETF, Exchange Traded Funds. Now I am not directly talking about  mutual funds. If you want to  invest in mutual funds, I will just tell you what you should  do. But there is something  called ETF. Now what is ETF? Exchange Traded Funds. What will  you see? I would like to  show you here because if I show you, you will understand more.  Alright, I will just show  you first. Only then you will understand. Okay, so I will just  show you. So now I am  using a platform, you can also use that. So if you want to invest  or you want to do  analysis of mutual funds, in fact, you want to do analysis of  mutual funds, you have a  platform of ticker tape, which can help a lot. I will also put  the link of ticker tape  in the description and comment box. So here when you simply write  ETF, you will get a  lot of ETFs, but which ETF? I am suggesting you two ETFs here.  One is the ETF of Nasdaq.  So this is the ETF of Motilal Oswal's Nasdaq. Understand what  it is. Now what is Nasdaq here?  Nasdaq is the top 100 companies of the US. I want to tell you  that you see that this  ETF is running for 90 rupees today. So if you see Rs. 90 here,  then it is running for  Rs. 90. In Rs. 90, there is an investment in the top 100 companies  of the US. Only in  Rs. 90. Now it depends on how much money you have. You can buy  as much ETF as you multiply.  You see what growth has come in this ETF in the last 5 years.  You will say that there  is a lot of growth in the last 5 years. Its low is of 38 and  high is of 138. It has gone  from 38 to 138 and it is a little broken now. So it is running  for Rs. 90. I would like  to tell you that if you invest in ETFs, then what is best for  you is that this is an example  of Nasdaq ETF. You can search more ETFs here, but you have an  advantage in ETF. I will  tell you in short. What you have to do is that you have to see  this. You go to any day,  you will see the returns here. The day you see negative returns  here, negative means  that the day the ETF is broken, you keep buying. So what will  happen with this, it has a formula.  I will tell you the formula. In fact, we have made a detailed  video on ETF, on ETF investing.  You can go and see the link on the I button. So I will tell you  that its formula is very  simple, which we use and which we recommend you. Suppose you  want to invest ₹ 5000 per  month in ETF, every month. So if you remove the set interest,  then 20 days are left for  trading. So if you divide by 20, then you have ₹ 250. That means  you are going to  invest ₹ 250 for a day. Suppose today ETF is looking at you in  positive. Today you invest  more, ₹ 250 is saved for you. Tomorrow it looks in negative,  tomorrow put the whole  ₹ 500. Then for 2-3 days, you see, for 4 days you see that it  is positive. Then one  day it looks negative, you put the whole ₹ 1000. So what will  happen, sometimes it goes  up, sometimes it goes down, sometimes it goes up, sometimes it  goes down. Do you know where  your investment is happening? Whenever it is down, your investment  is happening and  when you want to sell and you get a good growth, then you have  bought at a low price, you are  going to sell more. So ETF investing is a good thing. So I have  suggested you an ETF  for this. I will suggest you another ETF, but you should do investment  after your analysis.  You can also contact your financial advisor, but I would like  to tell you that Nasdaq ETF  is a good option. Similarly, you search Nifty B. So as soon as  you search Nifty B, like  Nippon, there are many other companies in the same way. So you  see here in ₹ 198,  now there are negative returns here. The day you see a negative  return, whatever money  you have, you can invest. Now there are two things here. I am  giving you this suggestion.  What is the suggestion? Someone says that instead of ₹ 5000,  I have ₹ 10000, but  I want to take exposure of the Indian market and I want to take  exposure of the US market  too. So what do you do, think of an investment of ₹ 5000 for  Nasdaq and think of an investment  of ₹ 5000 for Nifty and keep ₹ 2500 for both. So what will you  do, you will have investment  in the Indian market and in the US market. You will be diversified.  So I am guiding you  as a brother because there is no harm in investing in ETF. You  have already diversified. Nifty  50 means India's top 50 companies. Investment in India's top  50 companies is happening in  ₹ 200. So if you put ₹ 200, then money goes to 50 companies.  Similarly, Nasdaq,  if you invest, then money goes to the top 100 companies, which  is in IT, in which Google  and Apple have come. So all the big leading companies, Microsoft  and all, you got it in  Nasdaq. So for your analysis, you can do analysis here. Now there  is one more thing. Now if  you say that I want to invest in a mutual fund, then which mutual  fund, if you again  I will say that you have to do SIP or put Lumsum. Now as soon  as you come to the mutual  fund screener, you will see that there are so many mutual funds,  in which money should  you invest. There is a hybrid fund, there is a liquid fund, you  see blue chip fund,  you see flexi cap fund, in which money should you invest. Well,  we have made a detailed  video on mutual funds. If you have not seen it, then you can  go and see the link on the  I button. But here in one video, I have to tell a lot, so I will  tell you. My suggestion  is that if you are taking the horizon above for 3 years, then  you do not need debt, hybrid  and all. You select equity, money will be invested in shares,  means money will be invested  in equity. Now which company, you will get a lot of options in  equity, then you will  get confused. So according to me, you should select flexi cap  funds. Now here multiple  flexi caps have come. Now you can do your own analysis. You can  see here, you can see  each fund. For example, Kotak flexi cap fund is there. So here  you can easily study the  Kotak flexi cap fund. Now you have to do SIP in it or you have  to do Lumsum investment  in it. You can do this easily. Returns are good, expense ratio  is good. There is no  red flag here. You get analysis, you get a checklist and then  you can also do peer comparison  here. If you have to invest money in it or in someone else, then  you get multiple options  for peer comparison. So we are doing this analysis on ticker  tape. You can do it yourself  if you want. Link to ticker tape is in the description and comment  box. And if you want  to invest in mutual funds, then you will need a Demat account.  If you do not have a Demat  account yet, then you can go for free and open your Demat account  on Upstox. Now if  you choose Upstox, the advantage of number one is that it is  a discount broker. Here  the charges and commissions are very low and you understand that  if you invest in mutual  funds, then when you open an account on Upstox, you will get  a lot of mutual funds by going  to the discover section. So after doing the analysis, whatever  mutual fund you select,  you can do SIP on Upstox and you can also do Lumsum investment.  And what will be the  effect of this? Your money increases over time. Now how does  it increase? To understand  this, we will need a SIP calculator here and this is for you  as an example. I will try  to explain to you. If we talk about this, then CAGR means Compounded  Annual Growth Rate  is 12% of FlexiCap. In future, it can give better returns or  it can give less. So it  totally varies from mutual fund to mutual fund. But if we take  an expectation of 12%  and for your example, there is an SIP of ₹ 10000. So what can  happen with a SIP of ₹ 10000?  We understand this. For example, you invest for 30 years. So  there is a calculation for  ₹ 10000. According to the return of 12%, you can create a wealth  of ₹ 350 million  in 30 years. So how much can your wealth be here? The expected  amount is ₹ 350 million  according to 12%. This is an example. Now why did I say FlexiCap?  You will understand  by watching the video of mutual fund. What happens in this is  that the fund house has  the freedom that it can invest in large cap companies, small  cap companies, and mid cap  companies. So it is well diversified. So this is your choice  or else you can choose index  funds. You will see here that we come to the stock screenery.  So if I want to take index  fund instead of FlexiCap, your charges are less in it. So for  example, you take the index  fund of HDFC. You can also see its CAGR, what are its returns.  So if we talk about 5 years,  it is around 13% return. Now what can happen by getting 1% return  unnecessarily? Where  you are getting 3.5% return from the investment of ₹ 10000, if  you get 1% unnecessarily,  then it will increase to ₹ 1 crore, it will be 4.4 crore. So  ₹ 90 lakhs have increased  here. Now 1% return matters a lot, but why was I telling you  that 1% return matters.  Either it is a short term period or a long term period. We also  understood in the short  term period that if we keep money in FD, then 1%, 2%, 3% can  be extra. So when 1% matters,  then 3% definitely matters extra and if you have a little more  time horizon, you can start  with ETF. We talked about ETF or else you can choose mutual funds  and there are two  types of mutual funds.  and one we talked about your  other index funds and for analysis, I told you that you can use  468 0:20:06,500 --> 0:20:03,688 we talked about two mutual funds. One we talked about Flexicap  Ticker Tape. Now you  understood that if you have a little spare money, what you can  do. Now many people are  interested in trading in the stock market. See, if you want to  trade, I will tell you  genuinely, I am telling you myself that I am not a very aggressive  trader. Now I am  making a video in front of you. The market is running. The market  is almost going to  close. It is going to be 3.15. So what happened in the market,  what difference does it make  to me, why it doesn't matter. Today I am making a video on 9th  for you. In fact, I  will show you. So my laptop is also connected. I don't know now.  I have not even opened it  in front of you, but here we come to upstox. I do not know and  I don't care what happened  in the market. If you look below, here is a Wednesday. So you  know what I do on Tuesday,  Wednesday, Thursday, what strategy I use. I have already made  a video. If you have not  seen that video, you can go and see. There is a link on the I  button. Now whatever profit  is here, it does not make much difference to me. Why it doesn't  matter, whatever it is,  it is 83, it is 84, it is 80, it is 60, it is 30, whatever it  is, I know that profit  will come. Now why will it come? This is not rocket science.  You can learn that. See, if  you have, I will say here, for this strategy, if you have at  least more than 5 lakhs of  capital, then only this strategy will work. Means if there is  less than 5 lakhs of capital,  then you will learn something else. You will have to learn for  that. You will have to learn  for this too. So if you can give a little time with some spare  money, you can make a regular  income. Now this is something, now it is 93. What does it matter  to me that it is 93. Some  people will say that it is a good profit. Depending on how much  capital I have. I am  telling you genuinely that if it is going to be 90,000 plus,  then this is something that  I am getting 1% return in a day. 1% return in a day, you understand.  That means capital  above 90,000 is involved. So by investing ₹ 1 crore, I know that  I am getting 1% in a  day. Tomorrow I will get up to 2.5%. If it was Tuesday, Wednesday,  Thursday, like Guru  Nanak was born yesterday, then the market would have closed tomorrow.  So my trade was not  executed. Otherwise, I would have got 4%. So 1%, 2%, 3% people  will think what is this?  This is nothing, but there is a lot. When you compound with this,  a long-term wealth  is created. So I don't want to motivate you by showing you a  profit. It doesn't make any  difference. This is my individual. This is something which I  do. You know what it is.  You know it is an iron condor. Very safe. This is one of the  safest strategies which  I have learnt. So let's play it safe. It doesn't matter what  happens in the market, it goes  up or down. It doesn't matter as long as we make money according  to our setup. If you  want to learn this too, then the link is on the I button. You  go and learn, but you have  to learn for this. You have to give some time. You have to earn  money. You have to give some  time. You can learn if you give time, but if there is less than  5 lakhs of capital for  this, then there is no benefit. Then this strategy is not for  you. You need a little  bit of capital, but I tell you one thing. Learn it. There is  no capital today. There  will be many people. There will not be 5 lakhs today, but I say  that it is not today. If  you don't have money in your bank account today, then it is not  today. It can be tomorrow.  So if you learn, it will help you. Okay, so this is nothing.  Whatever will go to UC96,  UC97, I don't care about it because I am not selling it today.  I am carrying forwarding  the position, which I used to do. You know that Goddess Lakshmi  is made on you. Why  is it made? Because Warren Buffet has a very simple rule. Warren  Buffet's rule says that  the stock market game is an instrument to take money from impatient  people and give  it to patient people. I am seeing you impatient. I am not even  looking behind. What is the  difference? I mean, I don't care. Here, there is a profit of  1 lakh in front of you. So  whatever goes around 1 lakh, the market is up, it is down, where  it is, what is not, I  don't care. I don't care because I know that as long as it is  in my range, I have to get  money and tomorrow, whatever I said will be settled. So our account  has to be settled tomorrow.  Whatever profit will be there, it will come tomorrow. If there  is a chance loss, it can  happen. So it is not that any strategy is 100% accurate, but  you know what you are doing.  People say that there is a risk in the stock market. I say that  only until you don't know  what you are doing. If you know what you are doing, you will  make money. So I think it  is enough for today's video. This is enough for the day. So we  talked that if you don't  have spare, what can you do? I think I have given you enough  information. If you think  this video is valuable, please share it. We make videos so that  it is your help and  many people's help. So you can help us by sharing this video  and it will help many people  and if you are not with us on Facebook and Instagram, then you  can follow us there too.  You will get the link in the description and comment box. So  I will see you in the next  video. You will get the link of ticker tape and the link of upstox  in the description  and comment box. You can go to ticker tape and do analysis and  for investment you can  choose upstox. So we will see you in the next video. Till that  time you go self-development.

10,Misleading,"hi friends today I will share with you

six proven methods I tested to build an

income stream with prompt engineering I

will share both simple and advanced

methods so anyone can utilize this

opportunity but before we start in just

one minute in case you are a beginner

what is prompt engineering it is simply

the art of interacting with language

model it's how you talk with language

models like charging PT it's about

asking the right questions to get the

best answers for example this is chargpt

let's say you want to generate domain

names anyone can say generate 5 domain

names about email marketing this is what

we call a prom that texts the input you

feed the language model in our case is

chargpt and you will get an answer very

nice so this is a prom and this is the

answer one feed and prompt engineering

is how to craft the best prompt not like

this one let let me show you another

example delete this chat and I will

paste now my special private power

prompt to generate domain names I will

say also email marketing is a niche and

now let's take a look on this prompt and

the answer you can see we are getting

domain names with relevance why it's

effective and so on so we are getting a

better response better Answers by

utilizing these power prompts so prompt

engineering is how to create powerful

prompts to get the best answers out of

language models like charging PT or

googlebot and others and not only that

the other aspect of prompt engineering

is how to build and create automation

scripts if you are following for example

I built the chargpt earthquake script

that can search the web and then scrape

the content and then summarize and give

you like a Content research and like a

couple of seconds so in automation

screen tips we combine power prompts

with scripting to automate a certain

workflow so this in short prompt

Engineering in a little bit I will share

with you one of the best free resources

to learn prompt engineering starting

from today just bear with me a little

bit let's now go back to our main topic

and see our six proven methods to make

money out of prom engineering so number

one and I think it's the easiest or the

simplest approach which is selling

prompt templates and here we have two

options number one is to sell individual

prompts On Prom marketplaces for example

you can go here to promptbase.com create

an account and start selling click on

sell here and submit your prompts you

can see in my account I have bought all

these prompts from prompt base on their

website is snack prompt also you can go

here sign up and create and sell your

prompts the other approach in this

strategy is to sell a prompt library for

example I in my case I sell this premium

from library on my website so you can

package multiple prompts like this one

here and sell it together and to help

you I created two three full guides one

on how to craft and create powerful

prompts and the other guide is how to

sell these prompts you just need these

guys to go and start with this strategy

but wait a little bit let's see the

other five strategies maybe you change

your mind and go something more advanced

so let's see strategy number two which

is selling automated scripts as I

mentioned before prompt engineering has

two aspects the other aspect is about

creating automation scripts so we can

combine a powder prompt with a script to

automate a certain workflow for example

let me show you this I created this

sample script and here we have this

power prompt that is combined with this

script to rewrite articles let's go here

and run this by the way it's not that

complicated to build these scripts it's

really simple if if you learn how they

will tell you how in a little bit just

bear with me please so you can see here

a simple interface you paste the article

here and click on start and it will

rewrite the article so you can build

these scripts and sell them instead of a

prompt you build and sell automated

scripts you can go to websites like

gumro to sell any digital product like

scripts like prompts anything you want

so you can build scripts that converts

maybe articles into social media posts

maybe to do automated content research

we have a lot of ideas you can check

here my videos on my channel the GPT Max

Edition the charge EPT earthquake I have

a lot of ideas on my blog posts where

you can learn how to build these scripts

let's move on now to number three number

three is somehow more advanced a little

bit which is building customized AI

Solutions or tools for your clients for

example last week I showed you how to

build an AI tool on WordPress so you can

provide this service to your clients and

I mentioned in that video that I would

be publishing the YouTube title

generator tool the AI tool that can

generate the best YouTube titles and

it's now publish and live on my website

you can see here so you can build these

tools to your clients and what's nice if

you go here down you can get my free

guide on how I built this tool step by

step the prompts I use the code

everything so you can get all the

secrets behind this tool and utilize

this to provide as a freelancing service

or gig what's nice about these Services

it's still new we have low competition

so now is the right time to start if you

wait for a couple of months the

competition will be higher and you need

to Market more and so on now it's an

opportunity for you to provide these new

services and gigs now strategy number

four is one of my best instead of

selling a prompt or a prom template or a

script what you will do is you are going

to build an AI API and sell it on

marketplaces for example you can build

an AI content generator and sell on

rapid API if you check here my account

on rapid API I'm selling all these apis

here for a monthly recurring membership

it's really a great idea and what's nice

I have a full guide on how to get

started how to build apis how to sell

them how to Market them everything you

need I'll also leave a link in

description below now before we move on

to number five and six let me share with

you the top three courses and resources

to learn prompt engineering 2343

starting from today the first one is on

edx prompt engineering and advanced

charge GPT it's a free course the second

one on Coursera also it's called prompt

engineering for chart GPT the third one

is my free playlist here on my channel

it's a full playlist no ads and you can

go and check the comments to see how

powerful and beneficial is this series I

worked hard to make the best prompt

engineering videos here on my channel

number four is charging PT prompt

engineering for developers on the

planning.ai number five is

learnprompting.org and number six is

prompting guide dot AI I will leave all

these links in the description because

don't worry about them right now you can

see we have a lot of free courses that

you can start right now to master this

skill and build a business out of this

skill let's now move on to number five

number five is to start a SAS business

software as a service or simply building

online tools that you can monetize with

a monthly recurring membership or simply

keep it free a side project to grow your

business and get traffic and build your

email lists for example I build free AI

kit it's a set of free AI tools and a

web website where you can build AI tools

totally for free with no code so this

website acts as a side project for me

where I can promote my other products

like my prompt engineering course my

ebooks I can build email list so I can

provide value with this website in

exchange of building my business growing

my business the second website I have is

promoter kit a set of marketing tools

you can see here I'm promoting my API

promoting my ebooks I even add some

affiliate banners so you can build AI

online tools and sell for a monthly

recurring membership or simply monetize

with ad spaces or to grow your own

business with these powerful AI tools if

you want to learn more about this you

can check this video where I showed you

how I turned a simple AI tour from zero

dollars up to thirty thousand dollars in

value in just three months anyway so

number five is building online tools or

SAS AI business number six is education

and consultation after you learn these

courses that you have some experience

you can now provide a consultation

service or maybe create an ebook or a

course and sell it like in my case I

sell my prompt engineering Mastery

course go from zero to scripting

workflows and I create ebooks and

educational resources around prompt

engineering this new hot skill or it can

provide one-to-one Consultation Services

for businesses to automate their

workflows this is very important and

it's now new as I mentioned the

competition is still low so take action

and start today learn the skill we have

a lot of free resources start with my

free series I'm sure you will thank me

later it's free without ads learn the

skill and build your income stream see

you soon

"
11,Misleading,"hi everyone today in this video we will

see together how we can build a full

online business covering both technical

side and marketing side and with the

help of AI and Chad GPT I selected an

idea that somehow less competitive at

the same time we can Implement in

different ways and methods so it may be

a good choice for beginners and to

Advanced users the idea today is an

email validation service business so

people will pay you on a monthly basis

or buy credits to use your service for

example the balance is one of the best

and affordable email validation Services

if you're going to pricing people will

pay per credit so they can get 5 000

validations for ten dollars and so on

another example is my email radiation

software which is part of motor kit if

you go here to email section we have the

bulk email verifier where people can

relate emails for free and also I

implemented the API so people pays to

get access to the validation API all

these are different methods to build and

monetize and email validation service we

talk about all this in this video the

technical side how we can build such

Services how we can use Ai and charge

GPT how to Market this service sharing

with you some scripts a lot of value in

a couple of minutes and without ads stay

tuned and keep watching so let's start

and see what is an email validation

service unlike 30 seconds let's imagine

that it's your wedding party and you

send invites to all your friends but at

the wedding you found that half of your

friends didn't attend they are not there

you made a mistake you sent the invite

to the wrong addresses the same concept

applies in email marketing let's say you

create a product and you want to promote

your email list and you send a campaign

about 50 of the addresses were in were

invalid simply The Campaign Will Fail or

simply you will lose a lot of sales you

don't want this to happen this is where

the email validation service comes its

main role is to validate your target

recipients emails if they exist or not

before sending your campaign so today we

will learn how to build this email

validation system maybe you can use it

for yourself to cut down costs or maybe

to build a full business as you will see

today so let's start by picking a name

for our business like any business we

want to get a brand name or a domain

name you have two options you can

squeeze your brain and think about ideas

or you can simply use Char GPT let me go

to my premium prompts library and today

I will reveal one of my premium secret

proms let's click on this one let me

give you something for free I will copy

my prompt template this one and simply

paste inside chargpt and my Niche is an

email validation service that's just

paste that prompt I will give it to you

also by the end of this video so don't

worry about anything copying or

something just follow up now understand

the concept and then you can apply so

let's wait for chargpt and here we are

it will give you a list of domain names

or brand names with explanation why it

chose this name and you can pick one if

you want so let's say you did your

research you got some ideas and you

picked one that's somehow not the main

point now we got the name with the help

of charging PT step one done let's now

move on to step number two so how we can

build an email validation service we

mainly have three methods let's start

with the easiest approach is to buy a

ready-made script for example I searched

the web and I found on code Canyon a

script if you go here and search for

email validation I found this email

verifier Pro to be honest with you I

didn't test it but it has some good

reviews you can go to live preview and

test by yourself before buying if you

want if you buy this script you'll have

a full email validation business we have

the SAS version also you can buy it from

their website if you want to build a

business directly but to be honest with

you I don't prefer this approach

especially in our case in a technical

website like this one you understand

this more later in the video where we

playing the technical side behind email

validation it's somehow complex but in

general I usually buy a lot of scripts

if you go to my account here you will

see I have a lot of scripts I bought

from code Canyon some for research some

for starting a side project like for

example large file sender this is a

script I bought from codecany and you

can see today it's getting some traction

I can promote my other stuff and for

example free

image.ai it's also a script I bought

from code can I started a business

directly with it and it's getting a lot

of traction also I can also promote my

other stuff here so in short I don't

prefer using this method to store an

email validation service but in case you

decided to test it you want to buy it

and test it make sure to Rebrand your

script you need to do some styling make

sure to test everything the main problem

here is support if you face any

technical problem you need to wait for

the author to fix it and you are

providing a business you have clients

you have customers and you don't

understand exactly how it works so in

case you're a developer you're a PHP

developer and you understand the code

maybe you can go with this approach

somehow simple for you to start directly

but for beginners to buy a technical

script like this one it will be somehow

hard Provide support later on or to

update the script I mentioned it as a

tip maybe you need to test you need to

research or something but I don't prefer

this approach the second approach which

I prefer and it's somehow easy is to

build a validation service on top of an

API for example if you go here to

de-bounds and log in you see you have

the API option this API allows you to

use the email validation service but

using your own custom code and what's

really nice if you go here to

documentation inside the e-bounds they

have an awesome documentation really so

with the help of this documentation and

charging PD Can it can create the

validation script easily in like 10

minutes go into single validation and

you can see we have examples of node

Ruby PHP python even in c-sharp whatever

language you'll find all the codes here

you can just copy it paste it and try it

it's very simple for example

and promoter kit I do this I use my own

validation system Plus

apis like de-bounds now maybe the main

problem with this approach is we need to

write some code again charging PT is

here to help us if you go back to our

premium prompt Library let's go here and

search for python let me give you

another prompt for free from my library

so this prompt I will copy it go to

charge EPT new chart

paste

and simply this prompt will help you

write any python script will ask you

what type of script you want and so on

now I will save some time I already did

this and let's let's see here we are and

you can see now charge it wrote the

photo script for me that validates using

the E bounce API but the idea is we are

going to use an API to validate emails

and please Focus very well here a very

important tip is to use caching you know

we are paying for this API but what we

can do is to Cache validations like I do

with promoter kit here to cut down costs

so when a user verifies an email the

first time I catch the result then if

another one requested the same email I

will get the results from my cache

instead of calling the API so in this

way I can cut down the costs so use an

API with caching

to implement the email validation

service this is the second approach

before moving on to the third approach

which is the most advanced approach

which is building the email validation

service from scratch yourself let's see

how we can monetize how we make money

with these scripts the first method as

we mentioned is to build a SAS service

like the e-bounds or maybe you have

about never bounce all these are email

validation services that you pay them on

a monthly basis or you buy credits like

in the e-bounds to validate your emails

so the first model which is maybe the

most complex is building a SAS website I

will tell you a little bit how we can

build the interface we have multiple

options also just bear with me a little

bit the second option is to sell an API

on rapid API I think this is the easiest

approach as I explained before in my API

videos so you create a simple script and

you publish on rapid API and you sell on

a monthly base like this one here you

can see this is my email validation API

on rapid API and what's nice soon I will

have a full course about building and

selling apis for total beginners from

scratch you can join the waiting list in

the description below we have a link you

can join and secure your spot the third

method is by building a free tool like

this one on promoter kit you know it's

free anyone can use it but they need to

log in to sign up so in this way what

I'm doing I am building my email list

the second benefit of this website is

banner ads you can sell ad spaces or

promote you other products creating a

side project if you have a business

creating a side product is very

important it can get a lot of traction

to your business a lot of traffic

especially with online tools I mentioned

this a lot before how online tools help

me reach 1 million visits per month you

can check my guides in the description

below anyway now it's time to learn some

complicated technical stuff I'll try my

best to make it as simple as possible

even if you don't want to implement this

understanding these Concepts will help

you a lot in business in general and in

email marketing so usually when you want

to validate an email we have three

levels three steps number one is syntax

validation is to ensure that the syntax

of the email is correct like it has an

ad sign it has a domain name and so on

this is the easiest thing to validate

the second level is MX domain validation

it's simply connecting to the DNS of the

domain and checking if the DNS has a

male Exchange Server an MX record listed

this will help you ensure that there is

a mail server behind this domain this is

also somehow simple to implement with

python and charger PT the third level

which is the most complicated and here

where the problem is is validating the

existence of the target mailbox

usually to validate you need to send an

email if it bounces back it's unvalid if

it if it was sent it is valid but we

want to validate without sending emails

we want to validate the mailbox of your

recipients and here we have problems

like IP black listing when you try to

validate emails in bulk the mail servers

will Blacklist you so you will get

always access denial or maybe failures

or maybe invalid emails but in reality

you are blacklisted you are blocked so

Implement something like IP rotation to

validate emails in bulk and we add some

rate limiting we have a lot of technical

details here I will share all these

details by the way in a full guide and I

don't want now to go in detail

technically I will leave this spot for

people who want to go in deep I will

have a full guide attached with this

video and description below where you

can find all the scripts all the codes

all the prompts all details technical

stuff and so on but in short now in one

minute you must understand that in this

approach you need to write the full code

from scratch validating every single

level and implementing technical

requirements like multiple servers

multiple IPS rate limiting monitoring a

lot of things to ensure not to get

blacklisted and to get the right results

and we have problems like catch all

emails where the server will respond

always with valid email even if the

email is not valid like in Yahoo mail

servers so we have a lot of challenges

here I will keep all this for the full

detailed guide if you are interested you

can check it and read it it's totally

free I want to move on to building the

interface as I mentioned if you want to

build an online tool you need to be you

are if you want to build a SAS like this

one you need to build a UI an interface

user interface so usually we have four

approaches you can build it yourself if

you know like using react or next JS or

any

front end framework instead of wasting

time like two hours on YouTube shorts

and Instagram reels let's waste one hour

also on learning some technical stuff

that really helps you the second

approach is hiring a developer okay a

third one is using no code tools today

we have something like bubble.io a

website helps you build

websites without a single line of code

using known code tools we have a lot of

tools like framer like webflow do a

simple research I will also share some

in my detailed guide so you can check if

you want so the third approach is

building with no code tools and number

four is using Seminole code tools so we

have something like anvil

I mentioned also in one of my videos I

think handle python yes

this one it helps you build your eyes on

top of Python scripts this is why also I

tell you go and Learn Python scripting

it's really easy to learn and to give

you a lot of opportunities you can

automate things wide in your view on how

you can do businesses especially if you

are working alone at home like me or if

you are planning to have your online

business from home learning this skill

python scripting have a lot of

opportunities for you to help you in

your online business and marketing in a

lot of things by the way I have a full

python scripting course for beginners

inside my prompt engineering course I

don't know if you joined or not but if

you're interested you can check it also

in the description below so this is the

four ways to build UI Seminole code

tools no code tools hiring a developer

and building it yourself let's now talk

a little bit about marketing and

launching your product after you finish

implementing whether it's an API or

maybe a free tool or maybe a SAS

business I want to share with you three

main tips to to push your service to

Market your service number one is to

publish on product hunt you can see here

my websites are published on product

hunt this will give you some exposure

you can also add these badges on your

website to help people find your own

product hunt and review your products

the second way is by picking up two

platforms like Twitter and medium and

start creating content around your

service or your business and number

three is SEO I believe it's one of the

best I know it takes some time but it's

very important and especially if you

learn the lean SEO technique I mentioned

before where you pick like 100 keywords

and you create a template and you can

start filling up this template with blog

posts somehow fast and today we have

charging PT you can build a lot and

Target a lot of keywords to get a lot of

traction fast to your business and by

the way let me reveal and give you

something else if you go here to my

prompts Library marketing let me give

you another prompt also today so this

one the advanced keyword research SEO

plan this prompt will help you create an

SEO plan

based on the keywords for example let's

copy it go here to charge GPT a new

chart and paste and let's say

email validation service for example and

now this prompt you can see we have now

a table containing the keyword cluster

the long tail keyword search intent a

lot of things an SEO content strategy

you can use to push your business as I

mentioned all these prompts will be

available for free for you since you are

here with me supporting my channel maybe

with a like so you can get all the

details the prompts technical details

and the guide below this video and if

you are interested in learning how to

craft these power prompts and how you

can build automation workflows Learn

Python scripting connecting with

charging PT to build your automation

scripts you can check my full course

become a prompt engineer going from zero

to scripting automated workflows that's

it see you later

"
12,Misleading,"in this video I will show you how to

sell some piece of text called prompts I

will share with you three strategies to

sell them how to promote important tips

to stand out in the competition and get

your first customers a lot of value

without any ads in a couple of minutes

keep watching so what is a prompt it's

simply the input text you feed to a

language model you give to a language

model like charging PT or maybe an AI

image generator like my journey or

stable diffusion and this input this

prompt will highly affect and influence

the output in simple words if this

prompt this simple text was optimized

you will get good results if this prompt

was not optimized was bad you will get

bad results

it's that simple okay so now how to sell

prompts let's now say you crafted your

optimized prompt and you wanna sell it

how we mainly have three strategies

number one is to sell on prompt

marketplaces for example one of the best

marketplaces out there is prompt base I

myself I bought like 50 prompts from

this website not all are good by the way

but since I do some research about

prompt engineering I try to optimize in

different niches and do a lot of stuff I

need a lot of ideas I need a lot of

prompts test 12 so I buy from here and

there and do my research anyway the idea

is this Marketplace allows you to buy

and sell prompts directly on the website

other popular website is snack prom this

website like more a community where

people posts prompts and they share

their feedback and they allow you to buy

and sell prompts there so so the idea is

simple you just grab your prompt and you

publish on these websites we'll talk

about promoting later on but for now

these are marketplaces they already have

traffic you can post and sell your

prompts there the second strategy which

is somehow more advanced is to put

multiple prompts into a package and sell

it like a product and this is what I do

if you go down to my website the premium

prompts Library I sell it as a package a

package of prompts I sell it with my

prompt engineering course and if you're

going out to product hunt and search for

proms or charging PT prompts you will

find a lot of people doing the same now

how to start in the competition how to

sell your package I will tell you now a

little bit some tips in the marketing

section just bear with me two minutes

the third strategy is similar to number

two selling a package of prompts but now

we will sell it as a monthly recurring

membership or annual member version if

you are following me on my channel like

one month ago I published a video on how

to create a website Based on data and

sell it as a membership this one is the

best strategy since you are going to

establish a stable income stream but

here you need to focus on providing

really valuable prompts optimized

prompts not any prompts so users will

feed it every month you are updating

your library with something really

helpful focus on value again if you go

back to my prompts Library I don't have

many prompts maybe like 20 prompts only

but I work hard to publish only

optimized and tested prompts so users

will feel they are getting real value

out of these prompts Real Results saving

a lot of time you are solving a problem

so when they pay a monthly fee or for a

one package fee like in my case they

will feel the gut a lot of value now we

still have two things I want to share

with you tips to promote mode and get

your first customers and an important

idea if you want to stand out and scale

this business let's start with tips to

promote number one like any digital

product whenever you finish and publish

it you can go to product hunt and

publish this product and launch this

product for example when I create

promoter kit I published on Pro on

product hunt when I finished creating

VII kit I published on product hunt when

I finished my course I published it on

product hunt and so on this will help

you get some traction help get user

feedback reviews from people and give a

little push to your product launch

number two is to publish to AI

aggregators like two weeks ago I

published a video on how a new website

which is my free AI image generator tool

went from zero to two hundred thousand

visitors in two months only or three

months only with with the help of AI

aggregators today AI is trending and we

have a lot of aggregators websites where

they collect and share AI tools and

products if you share your tools and

products there you get some traction and

some traffic from these websites and

some of them maybe allow you to create a

featured post where you pay to get

featured on top of these big websites

number three which in my opinion is the

best strategy to sell a digital product

online which is building an email list

you create a lead magnet for example you

create a package of prompts you can pick

like five prompts of this package and

package it in a PDF or an ocean template

and give it for free as a lead magnet to

collect emails you build your email list

and then you have a treasure that you

can promote your premium products to

number four is to create content around

your product the idea is simply here

look a lot of people ask me how we can

succeed online how to build a real

business online

it's very simple the formula is very

simple it just requires you to work

consistently for like six seven eight

months or maybe one year

it's simply picking like two platforms

for example Twitter and medium and

create content around the product you

are selling build Authority build

audience build email lists and then it

will be a lot easier to sell anything

with your content these four tips will

help you get started will help you get

your first customers but it's not only

the way to promote prompts or any

digital product remember you are a

prompt engineer selling prompts you can

ask chargpt or googlebot anytime for a

full marketing strategy for example this

prompt you can see how long it is just

feed it to charging PT and you will get

like a full marketing strategy by the

way you'll get all the prompts

everything we mentioned today all the

details and more details on the full

guide and description below you can

check it if you want now the last tip

for today I think it's the best thing

you can do to stand out on the

competition and sell more valuable

product in terms of prompts is what we

call selling an automated script

workflow so instead of selling the

prompt alone you will package this

prompt you will put it inside a script

like a python script that will automate

a task for the customer for example

let's say your customer wants to do some

research for example you can create a

prompt that summarizes articles and you

combine with Google search as we learned

before in the charging PT Max Edition we

go to Google we get a top 10 results we

summarize them and the language model

charging PT will give you like a

research in like 2-3 seconds so you can

sell the whole script this automated

script to the customer in this way you

are giving more value something that

saves a lot of time for them they don't

need to test the problems by themselves

they just get the script run it and they

get resolved this is way powerful than

selling a prompt alone and this is

exactly what I teach in my prompt

engineering course how to build

automated workflows you can check my

course in description below and if you

want to start for free you can check my

videos here on my channel start with

this one no ads no sign ups just go

watch learn and start implementing and

start selling prompts not today tomorrow

see you later

"
13,Misleading,"look this video has no ads I'm not

telling you anything here I'm not

getting anything if you watch the video

or not it is just an experiment a

strategy I tried it worked and I want to

share it with you today if you want to

learn this strategy implement it stick

with me for the next five minutes I

promise you you'll not waste your time

the next three to six months is a great

opportunity for anyone to make good

money online I'm talking about a

strategy that can make you at least like

ten to twenty thousand dollars in the

next three months and can reach up to

100 000 or more so please Focus it's a

couple of minutes this may change your

life so what is that strategy the

experiment I did simply three months ago

I published a website without writing a

single line of code this website in

three months it passed 300 000 visits a

month in total it's more than one

million visit it got more than 48 000

backlinks according to ah shrifts and I

achieved this without writing articles

there is no blog without SEO nothing

just push the website according to

Flippa my website today was around 114

000 but let's be conservative let's say

around twenty to thirty thousand dollars

not too bad for the 90 days Venture and

guess what you can do the same so what

happened why it worked and why it can

work with you too simply the idea is

that artificial intelligence AI was

trending from the beginning of this year

and still trending this is why you need

to act fast you have a great opportunity

so what I did I created a free AI tool I

didn't develop it I didn't write any

single line of code I published it in

less than one hour simply I just went to

code Canyon I searched for a simple AI

tool I found this image generator tool

it's a SAS based script so I turned off

all memberships I kept it hundred

percent free and here we are we have

free image.ai my free image generator

The Next Step I did is I submitted this

tool to AI aggregators like Future tools

and other websites where people can

discover AI tools and simply the

combination of a trend plus a free tool

was irresistible my tool simply went

viral and I get traffic that I didn't

expect and now with some calculations my

site can be monetized with at least two

to three thousand dollars per month or

simply I can sell it according to Flap

as we mentioned 114 000. let's give it

out for 30 000 it's okay in three months

not bad that's what we call website

flipping please take this opportunity

seriously and what you should do right

now is Step number one is to find an

idea of an AI tool let me share with you

some tips to find great ideas is number

one is to go to product hunt and filter

out AI tools search for products on

product hunt or maybe on appsumo

products AI tools that are paid and

create a mini free version of these

tools and ideas also you can check

Future tools and other aggregators for

AI tool ideas other tip is to find AI

apis you can go to Rapid API and filter

out AI apis you can go to replicate and

check their awesome apis you can check

out NLP Cloud you can check leap for

image generation we have a lot of apis

out there that you can use to create

many free AI tools and of course you can

use open AI the big company behind

charging PT and gpt4 and what's nice

today if you learn some techniques like

vector databases and combine them with

GPT or open AI API it can save a lot of

money and costs running these apis you

can cut down your expenses you just need

to learn just think about something

other than Simple Text generation use

your brain your creativity your

imagination and do something think about

automating a certain task for specific

people or saving time for certain tasks

just think use your brain and to help

you more I will leave a link in the

description where I will share with you

some more ideas that help you craft a

good AI tool you can check it by the end

of this video so you found the idea

simply build this free AI tool how to

build it we are in 2023 we have no code

tools you can buy ready-made scripts you

can learn how to create them we have

awesome Frameworks like next.js or react

you can do this in a couple of hours

come on instead of watching Tick Tock

and YouTube shows for hours every day go

and learn something that benefits you

stop wasting your time time is passing

and will never come back you have to to

be grateful that you are born in this

era where we have this technology and

all these opportunities for you after

you build the tool you need to publish

it host it we can start also for free

with digitalocean with Walter even with

Google Cloud we have a lot of services

that offers you free credits to launch

your project I will also keep all these

links in the description below after you

publish your tool simply go to

aggregators and AI directories and

publish your tools there and to give

them a little push it's good to engage

on Reddit on Twitter and on medium this

will help you grow faster then when your

site grows you can simply monetize it or

sell it you can use tools like flip

estimator to estimate the cost of your

website the main reason for publishing

this video is to make you think again

stop wasting your time go and learn

skills that helps you change your life

start with python prompt engineering I

have three courses you can start with

them here my channel totally free

without ads just watch learn I will also

leave some other courses from other

channels I found them helpful I will

leave all these links in description

below if there is anything unclear we

have a forum on my website you can push

your questions and I'll be there almost

every day for you to help you to answer

your questions

"
14,Misleading,"the price of this Excel file can each up

to one thousand dollars or more just one

file in this video I will show you what

is this file how to create it how you

can do this and how and where to sell it

not only that I will show you how to

automate this process so you can

generate these files while you sleep and

I will show you four other methods to

make money out of these files even if

you don't sell it I have spent the last

two years researching and experimenting

in this topic and today I want to share

with you all this everything in few

minutes if you are ready let's stop the

idea is simple it's like data entry but

somehow Advanced it's about collecting

data from the internet and saving them

in CSV or Excel files let's see how to

do this the best way to understand this

is with a simple practical example that

I did I implemented here is my Excel

file where I collected keywords the

keyword the CPC C value the cost per

click the search volume and the paid

difficulty okay now the question is who

will buy this data what can I do with

this data how to monetize it you

understand everything in a little bit I

will show you practical real world

scenarios and examples of how people and

I monetize this data and how we sell it

and much more let us start with these

examples and show you five scenarios on

how to make money out of this simple

data number one what I did is I

converted this data into a tool called

high CPC keywords Explorer if you know 8

Super tools is the tool and here I

filtered out all keywords with high CPC

so people who want to run campaign ad

campaigns and so on can use this simple

tool to get these keywords and I

monetize this with ad spaces promoting

my products and other methods and right

now I am developing a new version of

this tool if you go here High CPC

keywords this is my new app website is

coming soon it's really awesome and you

can see now people can enter keywords

like for example email and can filter by

Language by country buy CPC balance by

volume bounce and then find these

keywords I made this tool somehow

Advanced with more filtering and I

provide this for users now it's still in

development we don't have data but I

think you got the idea we turn this data

into an online tool another example with

other type of data is a website called

creators who this guy here just collects

data from YouTube like the titles

thumbnails the industry and so on and

give a score for each video so you can

get title ideas so the same way he

collected data and turned it into a

membership website he charges like 19

dollars per month for this tool I did

also offer similar project maybe you

know it boost CTR I collected subject

lines that works and now I show them in

this online tool so people can come to

this website and see some examples of

good subject lines to use in their email

marketing campaigns to boost their

click-through rate you can simply

refresh and get a new subject line ideas

with their score with their formula and

so on so this is the first way is to

turn this data into an online tool

membership website so you'll have maybe

a full business with this collected data

you'll know in a little bit how I

collect data and how you can do the same

business focus understand the ideas

number two on how to monetize this data

is simply by providing it as a

freelancing service maybe you can

collect data for a specific scenario for

a specific client especially in AI

artificial intelligence they need a lot

of data so you can provide this service

as a freelancer number three is by

providing basic to Advanced Data

analysis with this data in a little bit

also I will show you a practical example

number four is simply by selling these

files directly on Market places so you'd

collect data and directly sell it as it

is number five is turning this data into

an API and this is one of the best

strategies that I love and it's super

easy to implement as you will see later

so five strategies we have building

online tool freelancing service into an

API sell directly and data analysis now

let's elaborate more and see how we can

collect data mainly we have three

methods number one is to collect

manually like I did with Boost CTR I go

and open inboxes and see the Perfect

Image subject lines I collect them I

curate them and then publish to my

website the same for creators hook this

data is collected somehow manually and

not automated the second way is with web

scraping web scraping is simply scraping

the internet the web pages and

collecting and reading data and the

third method is using apis like the one

I showed you with her CPC data I

collected it with the Google's API I

explained this in detail in this video

you can check it if you want how I

collect keyword data for free with

Google's API so these are the main three

methods let us talk now more about the

freelancing service I think you will

like this if you go here to Google

teachable

machine this website it's simply

developed by Google it allows you to

create AI model without coding look at

this get started I will go here to image

project anything now and now this simply

allows you to classify images so after

we finish trying this model it will

allow you to classify images you can

simply upload data here or from the

webcam and so on the idea forget about

this maybe I'll talk about this in

detail later on other videos the idea is

to train an AI model to teach the

machine we need data upload data in our

case now here it's images but the idea

is Nai data is the first thing we need

to start like in charge epd you know it

chargpt this model this AI is trained on

data a lot of data books online articles

a lot of text trained so it can generate

text like the one that is trained on so

an AI we need a lot of data and there's

a website called

click workers I think you'll love this

especially if you are a beginner this

website allows you to make money earn

money with a click worker anyone you can

simply maybe capture some screenshots

with your mobile phone and submit them

to this website and make money just sign

up and check it it's really awesome I

tested it and you can make like five to

ten Euros per day or maybe more with

this website so this is the idea about

providing freelancing Services maybe for

AI or maybe for special companies like

marketing companies maybe the a company

asks you to collect email data like this

one subject lines maybe CPC data like

this one maybe YouTube videos maybe

social media posts and so on you will

use scraping and apis to collect this

data organize it and provide as a

freelancing service number three is

analyzing data let me show you an

interesting prototype I developed last

week I created this simple API basic

data analysis is you can simply here

choose a file let's select the file on

my desktop this one that contains

keyword data enter the password execute

and look at this now what I did is I

used chargpt this AI in order to analyze

the data and now I just provided CSV

file and it will give me a simple

summary of this data and you can do the

same also by following my prompt

engineering Mastery series you will

understand how to combine AI with

scriptic develop these models these

prototypes and you can deliver as a

service we are in 2023 if you want to be

successful online you need to work and

invest in yourself learn these skills

and I'm here to help you I'm providing

you with free courses free services free

codes everything for free on my channel

you just need to learn test and

Implement so you can provide data

analysis using AI combining your data

that you collected with AI to provide

data analysis Services number four is

selling the data directly now this

depends on the data type a simple

example I just went to charge EPT and

asked it where we can sell a data I

collected about marketing first of all

it told me that you have to comply with

lows and this is very important you have

to understand be aware of violating

policies or collecting bad data or

something now we will consider

everything is ethical and good so I

asked at what marketplaces we have to

sell this data it gave me marketplace

with Oracle AWS did exchange live Ram we

have a lot of websites and data

marketplaces online you can also go to

forums discussions Facebook groups out

of places where people may be interested

in buying real data and valuable data

number five is turning this data into an

API and this is one of the best

strategies so you can develop an API and

sell it on websites like rapid API like

I do with this API my own API domain

I've heard of the I sell it here without

occurring monthly membership and what's

nice about this approach that you don't

need to be a developer here no coding is

required to turn data into an API how to

do this I'll keep it now a secret next

week we'll have a full video on how to

convert data into a real API without

writing a single sentence or code

nothing just interface will use tools to

build this API in less than 5 minutes an

awesome tutorial don't forget the

notifications to get notified about this

video and not only that I will publish a

list of things about web scraping

collecting data practical examples I

hope this video helped you got the idea

soon you will have practical guides

examples on how to collect data from

different examples from different

platforms using API scraping a much much

more I decided to create a full list of

videos about this top spec because it's

very important but for now if you want

to get into apis you can watch my full

video about how to build and make money

with apis here go and check it so you

can be prepared for our next videos soon

if you have any questions I'll be

waiting for you in the comments section

below I hope you enjoyed this video you

got some benefit see you later

"
15,Misleading,"this video is not about freelancing or

blogging affiliate marketing Drop

Shipping e-commerce and these additional

ideas no today I want to share with you

a new business idea that I have been

testing for two months now and I didn't

hear anyone talking about it so it's a

great opportunity for you to start

working with this idea today because the

competition is still very low and what's

really nice about this idea you can

Implement from anywhere any country and

it's 90 automated as you are going to

see right now like any business idea

it's about solving a problem for

specific people in our case those people

are local and small business owners or

simply anyone having a website that face

problems like slow websites malwares

backups and security bad designs and

templates lack of support and management

and so on so we are going to solve their

problem by providing all-in-one service

and save them a lot of money and what's

really nice about this business this

service you are not going to do anything

everything will be automated you just

need to manage things I call this idea

that drop hosting business model it's

somehow similar to drop shipping and

drop servicing if you know them in terms

of automation but the idea and

implementation is somehow different okay

the question now is how to start of

course I wanted to tell you go and build

a web hosting company of course not we

need a simple approach I did a lot of

research to find the perfect service

that fits this business model and I

finally found it 10 web.io it's like

those guys build their service to fit

our business model exactly I tested it

it's a great service it allows us to

implement exactly this business model

without worrying about anything I mean

it anything you will see right now let's

go the Practical example to see how

things really works live right now so

here is my 10 web dashboard these are

the combination of my websites and my

clients websites now you have a client

facing all the problems you mentioned

before and you want to solve their

problem you want to provide this service

this one click migration will move your

clients website to your dashboard in

minutes so you will have your clients

website here let's assume that this is

your client's website just for testing

purposes now click on it you will see

you will get 90 plus speed score

automatically with this awesome service

so we fixed the first problem website

speed if you go here to backups you can

click on manage backups and then

schedule automated backups on daily

basis every 12 hours even real time you

can even download the backup if the

clients want it so everything is

automated we saw the second problem

which is backup if you go here to tools

you can simply install a free SSL we saw

the third problem you can go here to

image Optimizer to optimize the images

also for free all these services and

tools and features are available with

the website when you migrate that's

awesome let's go now to the AI Builder

look at this I will show you now

something really shocking let's say your

client liked a website design let's say

this website backlinku so he told you I

want something like this one here you

just get the URL copy it Ctrl C you go

here click add a new page and then click

on AI Recreation and insert the URL with

title you have exactly the same design

the same header also everything so this

is really perfect you can create headers

Footers you can add new pages based on

portfolio if you want many use anything

so this AI Builder is really awesome it

helps you a lot it's super easy to

create the perfect flop sites for your

client in minutes now maybe you are

wondering okay what if my client faced a

technical problem something I can't

solve what can I do don't worry I told

nice about 10 web they provide 24 7 live

worry about support everything is solved

here not only that let me show you the

awesome features inside 10 web just in

five seconds malware removal free SSL we

have an additional Cloud Floor

Enterprise City and add in you'll get up

60 boost and in performance you can get

DDOS protection firewall you have the AI

have a team with your friends you want

to build a business together you can add

all the team in this workspace and work

together you can create staging websites

you can white label this let me show you

this this is an awesome feature white

labeling if you go here back to the

website and you go here to White Label

then let's say you want to name your

plugin as my awesome service anything

you want and you can upload any log you

want here and let's choose the website

that we are testing apply then if we go

back here to our website you will see

now manage my awesome service cache so

the plugins now is white labeled your

client will see your brand your name in

their website it's like a professional

service and what's really important

about 10 web is the Simplicity of that

platform you can learn everything in

like one week and start the business now

it's time to do some calculations to see

how much money we need to invest in this

business and what is the expected

earnings what is the expected profit

let's see okay so this is the pricing

page inside 10 web and we are looking at

the agency plan we are running a

business so if you switch to the annual

plan you will save 30 it costs you 60

dollars per month with the annual plan

with this plan you get everything we

need and 10 free website slots so you

have 10 clients ready to manage with

this plan in my case I charge around 37

or 36 dollars per client per month so my

profit is around 30 dollars per client

you can see here one website costs you

around six dollars so my profit is 36

minus six which is thirty dollars and

with the CDN add on I charge six dollars

so my profit will be around 32 dollars

per month you don't need to set the same

price it depends on your country on your

region in which country is the client

what type of website and what type of

service you can provide I will tell you

a little bit also how to scale this you

can charge maybe 100 200 per month as

you will see right now even just some

patience so the annual plan costs 60

dollars per month and this is what you

need to invest in your business to get

all these services and the VIP support

that you need as an agency as a business

not to worry about any problem or any

technical problem you face later on with

your clients not only that if you are

ready to start this business 10 web this

week is running the biggest discount of

the Year an extra 30 discount this week

and November 28th I think if you use the

link in the description you'll get this

extra 30 so the client will cost you

around 4.8 dollars with the AGC plan per

month and you can increase your profit

don't be in a rush you have one week go

now in the comments section ask any

question you want I'll be here to help

you to clarify everything you want if

you are ready go click and start this

business not only that in this video I

will share with you the starter drop

hosting guide a PDF will show you all

the resources everything explained the

company questions is in this PDF you'll

be able to download a little bit now I

will share with you the link then you

can read it and you will have everything

to stall this business and it's totally

free okay now you got the idea it's time

to get your first clients so first of

all set your target goal goal to get a

maximum of three to four clients only

since 10 web costs 60 dollars with

annual plan then three four clients

charging only twenty dollars per month

will help you pay all the monthly fees

and all other clients from now on will

be your pure profit so how to get our

first clients simple answer Outreach we

don't want to use any paid methods paid

ads or pay advertising nothing just

without reach and mainly with cold

mailing or LinkedIn Outreach or maybe

contact forms any way to send a message

to a potential client that's all you

need to start and get your first clients

to do this you'll need mainly four

things let's say we are going to cold

mail prospects or potential clients so

you need a professional email address

you can get one with Google work suit or

maybe with Zoho free business email you

need a service a software to send cold

emails you can start with g Mass it's

also simple and you can start for free

you need a service to validate emails

before you send you can go with eight

super tools my free service and number

four you need an email copy to send to

your potential clients and I will give

you this for free also so everything

will be in your hands to start with this

business as I told you it will be

available for free with the starter

guide in this video just some pages I

will give you the link to download okay

now the second question how to find

potential clients to contact it's not

that big deal let me show you an example

so the first method is Google Maps we

said that our Target clients or local

business owners for example let's say

you want to Target people in Switzerland

you go here let's say Linux for example

and it will show you now medical centers

in the country you targeted and of

course you'll get information like the

phone number if they have a website

their location this is the website light

and so on so you can search for

businesses through Google Maps or simply

you can just navigate the web for

example let's say you want to Target

people in a certain Niche for example in

the cooking Niche you can go and find

websites here just try to go down in the

list to find not the top websites

because I think already they have a team

managing the website let's say in page

three this website so what you are going

to do get this website for example and

go to Google page speed insight and

check their Pages speed so if you find

that this website is somehow slow it

will be an opportunity for you to

contact and tell them I'm gonna fix your

website you got the idea so just pick a

niche and search for new websites for

business websites local business

websites on Google Maps or simply on

Google test them check if they have any

problems with SSL with the speed design

anything and contact tagged them and

offer your help to solve their problem

and manage their website it's somehow

simple as I've told you you'll find

everything in the starter guide the

copies will be inside so this website

performance is 78 not bad it's better to

find something with performance 50 or 60

or less so this somehow optimized anyway

you got the idea and this way you can

search for clients and customers for

your business so you need to Target

three four clients at the beginning to

start and grow this business before we

move on and show you how to scale this

business I want to talk about something

maybe it's important for you especially

if you are a beginner if you feel this

is an idea somehow complicated and not

for you now even though it's an

opportunity but let's say you feel it's

somehow complicated to start with as a

beginner you can simply use the same

idea the same approach but as

freelancing gigs what do I mean you can

simply provide this service as a gig on

freelancing websites like Fiverr

freelancer upwork and so on for example

you can provide a service to get 90 plus

speed score on the website you can

provide a service for web page cloning

designing with the AI Builder or simply

WordPress installation or even you can

join the affiliate program to a 50

commission for the first 12 months now

what about that payment a lot of people

contact me ask about payment methods

that doesn't work in their countries and

so on what's nice about this business

model that you can get paid with

whatever way you want it's up to you and

to your client with payoneer with PayPal

with bank transfer maybe offline payment

any way you want it's up to you now in

the last minute I want to share with you

business please Focus very well it's

how to scale this business let me give

you some fast ideas first of all you can

go and start creating content on social

media on medium on YouTube to get more

hours to get more clients the second tip

is to start your own business and create

a professional landing page so clients

can see your work your other clients

testimonials and so on number three

after you get some clients and you have

some extra budget you can run and test

paid advertising of course after you

learn about paid ads and the most

important tip in scaling is providing

add-ons and additional services like in

my case for example I provide some

marketing services so you can provide

lead generation you can provide uptime

monitoring SEO strategy content creation

two thousand dollars per month as I do

okay maybe our new here and wondering

and asking why you should listen to me

and watch this video maybe it's like all

other videos on YouTube that waste time

and just share fake numbers and false

promises you should watch this simply

for three main reasons number one is

honesty I never share with you fake

numbers or fake promises I'm very

transparent in this video you can start

with zero dollars you don't need money

but you need to work at least 2-3 hours

a day for at least 2-3 months to build

an income stream if you are not willing

to do this just pause the video or skip

it or go and watch other videos we need

to work here the second reason is I

never shared anything on my channel

except if I test it so all my videos

let's be honest 99 of my videos are

based on real case studies real numbers

real experience more than seven years of

experience working online and number

three is simply I will provide free

one is to pick a topic or a niche to

work in to make things simple for you I

will give you a PDF with a lot of topics

and ideas and to pick one of them the

format is very simple pick a topic that

you love or you love to learn about or

you know about in this way you not feel

once understand the idea and then you

can Implement directly after watching

video I will go with an example let's

say my topic is YouTube marketing or

YouTube growth I will share I will teach

people how to grow on YouTube for

example so we finish step number one

step number two is to create a list of

blogs in your Niche simply go to Google

dot com and write down your topic for

example in my case it's YouTube

marketing blogs for example in this way

you'll have a lot of results 15 best

YouTube marketing blogs up in this

this for example I will see a lot of

websites here talking about YouTube what

you will do is simply go here to notion

dot s o notion is a software free

software to manage everything you want

you can see how I manage my business my

research my personal stuff everything

here inside notion you should do this

also so if you don't have an account

just sign up super simple hello create

now and you page I will call it

affiliate

business

and step one pick a niche in my case it

is YouTube marketing I will turn it into

a heading and here we are we finished it

let's go to copy Emoji get a check I

will get a check mark emoji copy it and

then very nice

we got it I'm doing this I'm showing you

this also to help you organize your

business organize your work so another

heading is step two which is list of

blogs ability list and now I will start

copying eyes for example this website

real and real okay this first website

you paste here we have also a YouTube

blog official YouTube blog we can also

paste it here and so on so just create a

list of 5 to 10 blogs in your Niche step

number three is simply to subscribe to

all newsletters in your Niche for

example again go to Google YouTube

marketing news letter we have here

mabrew and just start searching here for

newsletters and your Niche for example

we have this awesome Creator hook an

awesome newsletter by the way for

YouTubers if you want to join so also go

here and join it I'll tell you now while

you are doing this so I joined this

newsletter go and join three to five

newsletters at least in your Niche so we

are done here join and use letters we

are done now step four follow YouTubers

in your Niche again the easiest way is

to go here to YouTube and search for

your topic YouTube for example growth

and you'll find a lot of channels like

film Booth one of the best channels by

the way you have two body we have Justin

Brown Primal video think Maria all these

are in the niche I selected so it goes

and subscribe and follow these channels

and you are done it's that simple now

the question why we are doing this why

we are joining YouTube channels

newsletters and blogs in our Niche

simply because we don't want to waste

time finding ideas so every day you can

just to these blogs to these newsletters

to these YouTube channels and pick ideas

you have a bank of ideas to pick out

from your Niche especially if you are a

beginner you don't have time and

strategy to plan and do some content

research this is the easiest way for you

to start with now before we continue

there's something very important

changing this icon it has nothing to do

with affiliate business so let's pick

another one for example here in emojis

let's say business or something like

that and I pick this one maybe it's

better so step number five and here we

are going to solve the real work

everything we did before is super simple

just joining and creating a list and

doing some research on Google Now in

step 5 we are going to search and find

affiliate programs in your Niche one of

the easiest ways to go here to Google

again and search for YouTube which is

your niche in my case it's YouTube

YouTube marketing affiliate programs so

simply add your Niche here and write

affiliate programs and then start

searching for programs in your Niche now

to save you some time I will also

provide you with a special resource it

will help you a lot to pick affiliate

programs like a directory of all

affiliate programs in any Niche you can

pick from and start with now to save

some time I know some programs for

YouTube for example I can promote with

IQ to body maybe some rush and so on let

me show you this if I go to

youtubebody.com this is a tool for

YouTubers to help you grow your YouTube

channel I use it as one of the best

tools by the way and they have an

awesome affiliate program and you can

see here my dashboard so for December I

have around 300 dollars revenue and so

on you get the affiliate link here and

you are going to promote this affiliate

link so step number five is simply

finding affiliate products in your Niche

also this somehow is simple about

picking programs now step number six

create a medium Vlog simply go here to

medium.com on medium you can simply

create a free blog just sign up and

you'll have a free blog for example here

is my profile here is my blog and by the

way I published some interesting

articles on medium you can check it if

you want so that's simple we create a

blog on medium step number seven is to

plan three to five ideas to write about

on medium don't worry on medium we're

not going to write big articles it takes

a lot of time the idea is different on

medium you will see right now in Step

number eight so plan three to five posts

to publish on medium or to be more

accurate three to five post ideas how we

do this if you remember in Step number

two three and four we got a lot of

sources to get ideas from so from

newsletters from YouTubers from blogs

you can simply pick some IDs and titles

to write about let's say for me I will

create a list how to get 1000 Subs on

YouTube other idea for example how to

create the best thumbnail what is a b

split testing and how it helps YouTubers

so I plan three ideas for my medium blog

and you have to do this in your own

Niche now step number eight how to

create the perfect post on medium please

Focus very well it's somehow different

than any blog medium is somehow

different and special please Focus to

get the best out of medium get free

traffic without worrying too much about

promotions and getting traffic from here

and there and backlinks and SEO and so

on please Focus this step is very

important I want to talk about three

important factors to be successful on

medium I think it's the main important

factors and it's enough for now to start

with maybe later on in the upcoming

videos we can go in depth and medium and

see how we can grow on medium how to get

more followers what are the best

practices and much more but for now for

the sake of this video not to go out of

scalp I want to focus on only three main

factors number one let's take a look on

my posts you can see two minute three

five minutes reads six minutes read

three main three so the posts are

somehow small and to the point number

two the titles look at the titles how I

got 1.3 million visits in 12 months we

are talking about catchy titles

multiplicates of course for now don't

focus on SEO and keywords and these

Advanced Techniques just focus on catchy

titles for anyone scrolling on medium to

catch them to click and read your posts

so it's somehow like YouTube you need to

care about the click-through rate how

much people are clicking on your

articles to read it so if you open like

this one here how I got 1 million views

on my website click and look at the

style of the post this the third main

factor you can see it's super simple and

I'm using big headings number one number

two number three under each one I'm

using a small paragraph So it's direct

and to the point with some images and

proved with some emojis anyone can read

it and get the idea out of it of course

it's valuable but I'm talking about the

style of the post make it simple to the

point and clean so in short if you want

we can work and deal with medium as a

social network where people are posting

and you need to attract them to your

posts and articles for example look how

medium recommend some articles it's like

YouTube suggestions so look at people

and how they write articles how to get

100 000 profile visits in a month on

Twitter eight must have Google

extensions so you need to use titles to

increase click-through rate so this is

about medium and how to structure and

post on medium and by the way if you

need a free AI writer to help you write

artex and posts you can go to eight

super tools AI writer it's totally free

tool to use but make sure listen

carefully make sure to use this as a

writing assistant not generate copy and

paste it will not work if you are stuck

to create an introduction if you are

stuck in a statement or something you

can use the AI to help you continue and

write your paragraphs but don't rely on

it so this about medium let's now move

on to step number nine now it's time to

promote your affiliate links inside your

medium posts but please be careful and

listen very well don't overuse affiliate

links and spam them here and there we

don't need that look at my example so if

you open this article for example here

on my blog I'm on medium blog and you go

down here you will see I'm talking about

something called content analysis by

phrase using phrase so I'm sharing how I

use this tool to get traffic it's called

phrase.io and I'm sharing this link here

you can see this is an affiliate link

it's simple and the second thing you

have to do is adding this disclosure at

the end some external links in this post

are affiliate link you have to add this

also inside your medium posts if you

have affiliate Links of course like in

our case so simply add your affiliate

links don't overuse don't spam and add a

disclosure and everything will be fine

and one important thing if your

affiliate program allows you to track

your source for example like phrase I

will go here to phrase I will log in to

show you this so here is my dashboard

and the links here you can add your own

custom links for example this one here

you can see it has a sub ID called

medium so when I wanna track my earnings

and my Clicks in an affiliate program I

can know from which website or from

which source I got these clicks so it's

important to promote to add this sub ID

if it's available of course to know how

many clicks you are getting on these

links from your medium blog posts now in

Step number 10 which is simply you have

from now on to create two to three posts

on medium on a weekly basis and track

your performance make sure to pick the

topics the right topics but you can

promote the athlete program within and

then post on medium like every other day

and you can track how many clicks you

are getting and your conversions and so

on so you can optimize based on this

analytics a small gift also for you you

can go here to link dot me a free link

shortening service sign up totally for

free and then you can add your special

domain and track your clicks all over

the Internet totally for free so we

finish step number 10 we still have only

two steps I hope you are getting some

benefit and everything is clear don't

forget as I told you if you have any

questions anything I'll be waiting for

you in the comments section below step

number 11 is to be build your email list

this is very important whatever you are

doing online building an email list is

on the top list of promoting and

building and growing your online

business and what's nice about medium it

allows you to build an email list for

free and do email marketing for free for

example if you go here to my stats and

go to audience stats you will see how

many followers how many email

subscribers I have on medium and you can

also click on view details to see those

people and see those emails and also you

can export this list and go here to any

email marketing software like for

example convertkit which you can start

also for free and you can import those

email subscribers into your own platform

and do your own email marketing this is

very important so step number 11 is to

build your email list and start with

email marketing we are done we still

have the last step which is scaling to

reach one thousand dollars as I told you

if you found all these steps and like

three to six months you will reach

around five hundred dollars a month but

what if you want to scale this to reach

one thousand or two thousand we will see

this in Step number 12. but before that

I want to share with you all the

resources I mentioned everything the

tools free PDFs everything I mentioned

in this video so to get this totally for

free simply open this link h-y dot me

slash zero Dash affiliate and you'll get

all the resources totally for free now

it's time step number 12 which is

scaling to one thousand dollars a month

please take notes so when you reach a

step or you are doing around 300 to 500

dollars you need to apply these

strategies to scale up to one thousand

dollars per month and more and build a

stable online business so how to do it

number one is to repurpose the same

medium posts on other platforms for

example we can create a quora space go

to CODA create a space and repurpose the

same post inside your space here to get

more traction more traffic from Cobra

reach other audience also you can create

a special version for social media for

example I create mini version of my

posts on social media like this one here

on LinkedIn on Twitter on Instagram on

Facebook on publish everywhere so

repurposing your content on different

platforms will help you grow and get

more traffic and reach more people over

the Internet number two is to scale your

blog with your own dedicated blog you

know I have hdk if you are following me

this is my own blog so again you can

repurpose the same post with a long form

post content and grow with SEO so here

in your own blog posts we can optimize

for SEO we can trigger titles the

content and so on to grow and reach more

people with Organic traffic from Google

and number three is simply joining more

affiliate programs and promoting more

affiliate programs so you can build

multiple income streams from different

programs for example here I'm promoting

phrase this is Jasper this is tubebuddy

and so on I promote maybe more than 14

affiliate programs and my own Niche my

digital marketing Niche so in this way

you can establish multiple income

streams from different programs and

number four and I think it's one of the

best ways to scale your affiliate

marketing strategy is to start a YouTube

channel it's also almost for free you

can start from home recording videos and

you don't need to show your face if you

don't want you can create tutorials

using Camtasia Studio as I do and

publish them on YouTube and you can use

the power of video SEO to rank your

videos If You Now go to YouTube for

example and search for this keyword get

free traffic you will see that my video

is on top of YouTube so with the power

of video SEO you can get a lot of

traffic from YouTube search results

maybe you're wondering now how I can do

the same game and rank my videos on top

of YouTube Simply you can check out this

video here where I explained in detail

step by step how to rank your videos and

get free organic views from YouTube and

and this guy to mention only free

services so you don't need to pay

anything you can start with zero dollars

without any investment let's go to

walter.com just click on this link in

the guide you'll get in a little bit

this is the website and simply click on

sign up and continue that process I

don't want to waste time with this now

let's create an account and then log in

let's log into my account and simply go

here to referral program and then to

this section here give hundred dollars

get 35 dollars we have this link here

copy it and open notepad and paste the

link here so this is the first step we

are done congratulations it's that

simple let's now move on to step number

two step number two is to go to website

called link dot me and also sign up for

a free account again I will open my

browser go here link dot me go to

pricing section you will see we have an

unlimited free account here just get

started and sign up for a free account

that simple then log into your account

also I have one already click login and

here I am in my account your dashboard

will be empty since it's a new account

it's okay but anyway congratulations you

finished step number two so we have a

free account on Walter we have the link

and we have a free account on link dot

me let's move on now to step number

three we are going to do two steps here

adding our domain and branding our link

so let's start inside link.me here go to

something called branded domains in this

section you'll need to add your domain

name your website name if you don't have

one you can go and buy a domain name

from websites like GoDaddy or namecheap

you can simply go here to godaddy.com

and simply search for a name any name

you want to feel it's a brand name for a

website let's say web hosting tutorials

for example let's check if it's

available or not okay the.com version is

taken let's go down you can find like

this one.net you can buy it if you want

for ten dollars for like this one for

0.01 so it's not that big deal but

anyway if you don't have any single

dollar to invest it's okay what we can

do simply is to watch my video about

making two to five dollars per day with

micro tax I shared with you a full case

study how you can make two dollars per

day even if you don't have any skill

just buy some clicks working around five

hours a day you can make this money I

know you will maybe invest four or five

days to get a domain but if you you want

to work hard you want to achieve this

you have to do it or you need to invest

10 for a domain name it's better so here

in this section simply click on add a

domain and simply now copy this IP

address here copy it and then go to your

domain DNS management settings like in

my case I have this sample domain just

to demonstrate this you can see we have

the main a record it's pointing to an IP

address so usually a domain will point

to your main website address so in our

case we don't want to change this IP

it's better to create a sub domain for

example click add and I will say here a

record let's say links for example and

paste the value and click on ADD record

if you have a dedicated domain for

Branded links go for it you can use it

for the main a record but if you have a

website you can do this you need to use

a sub domain and if you are wondering

can I use something else other than

link.me like pretty links on WordPress

or other branding link servers you can

use whatever you want here I'm sharing

with you this service because it's

totally free anyway go here simply write

HTTP and add your sub domain in my case

this and my root domain my website is

this and a domain and here we are then

simply go back to your dashboard copy

the link you got from Walter paste it

here open the settings and select your

custom branded domain name here in the

Alias section add the word Volta for

example and click on shorten now you

will see we have this new branded link

you can see I forgot to add the T it's

okay so we have this branded link that

we can share and promote Walter with so

maybe you are asking why we did this why

we added this branded link why we can't

use this directly for two reasons later

on we are going to promote load this

link we are going to make people sign up

through our link so when we are going to

share this link out of places on the

internet don't like such types of

referral links so it's better to use a

branded domain link under your domain

name the second important reason that if

Walter changed this link for some

reasons because for example they stay

here the school is available for a

limited time so maybe it's changing

later so if you already promoted the

link let's save in 30 places and you

want to change this link later you need

to go to every single place you've

pasted the link and change it while with

this method we can simply now edit this

link only can edit this change it here

and all links and every place will

change automatically because we are

promoting our branded link I hope you

got the idea this is very important for

link management so congratulations we

finished step number three let's now

move on to the most important step today

which is Step number four promoting this

referral link just to make sure you

understood the idea what you are doing

here in this strategy we are simply

promoting this referral program so

anyone who signs up using your link they

will get hundred dollars free credits on

Walter and in return when they pay for

the service when they pay 35 dollars you

will get these 35 dollars for yourself

you will earn them I believe these types

of programs are the best to promote

especially for beginners because in this

way you are giving people something for

free or giving them credit so you are

giving them a reason to sign up through

your link or giving them something for

free it's very important so it's now

time to promote our affiliate link it's

time to promote and make people sign up

to Walter through your link this is very

important please Focus very well I will

explain around five strategies to

promote this link when it comes to

promoting affiliate links and referral

links we have more than maybe 20

strategies but I want to focus on five

today I believe it is the most important

strategies to promote similar programs

like walter.com so the first one is

freelancing gigs what do I mean by this

please Focus it's very important let's

take an example write an example from my

website go to age educate.com let me

show you what I do if you go to the

service section you will see I provide

this service here for example setting up

a mail system on mounting or setting up

a PHP script if you open this service I

am providing this as a gig as a service

you may be doing this on Fiverr or any

freelancing website but I do this on my

main website when someone wants to buy

this service from me setting up a server

or a script if you go down here you will

see the requirements or to get a VPS

machine and I'm sharing the VBS services

like contable like ovh or Stinger until

server and all these are affiliate link

things so what we can do is to combine

freelancing with affiliate promotion

this is very important so you can double

your earnings with freelancing promoting

VPS Services through freelancing gigs

you may tell me now I want a freelancer

I don't provide service online okay my

job is to tell you the ideas or the

strategies I do and it's your job to

choose the best that fits your scenario

let me give you some examples of

freelancing gigs maybe you change your

mind and start working online today with

these gigs so the first gig is set up a

PHP script on a VPS server so you will

ask them to get a Walter VPS and you'll

install the script set up a mailing

server set up WordPress on a VPS server

migrate your website a VPS server setup

on a face marketing website set up a

website like YouTube create a website

like YouTube for clients like any other

clone you can do simply that's open

again now browser go to code canyon.net

go to PHP script for example I will

search here for play to let's say

someone one of your clients wants a

website like YouTube so you can get this

script for him PlayTube which is similar

to YouTube and let him buy this through

your affiliate link on code Canyon and

buy a Walter VPS through affiliate link

from Walter and provide the freelancing

gig so you can make money from free

sources in one operation think about it

it's a really good idea so we have here

a lot of scripts you can go over and

check and provide services based on

these scripts like building an

e-commerce website like building a SAS

service a lot of scripts here you can

get ideas from anyway that's enough for

the freelancing gigs examples let's move

on now to strategy number two which is

tutorials it's one of the best

strategies to promote hosting services

and especially VPS services so the idea

here is to create tutorials and promote

voltage to that you tutorials for

example you can create a tutorial how to

set up a PHP script how to set up

WordPress on a VPS server how to migrate

site to VPS how to create a website how

to install multiple websites on one

server and so on I will give you all

these ideas in a little bit so these are

all ideas of tutorials you can write

about for example if you go back to my

website again and let's go here to my

blog usually I have this article here to

install WordPress on a VPS server this

is an example of a tutorial you can

create and if you go down here you will

see all these green links are affiliate

links compatible digital option let me

show you this by the way if you go into

digitalocean again it's a similar

website to Walter I also promoted we'll

discuss this in Step number five are

scaling how you can use multiple

Services you can see here I earned

around twelve thousand dollars till

today I referred around 268 000 with

this program I make around 300 every

single month also from digitalocean

using the same strategy anyway so all

these are examples of tutorials you can

create and promote Walter VPS Services

through and you don't need WordPress

website or to pay for hosting it's up to

you if you have a Blog you can do this

or WordPress maybe on a blogger.com

which you can create a website for free

with Google also you can use medium if

you go here to medium.com you can create

a free blog and start blogging medium is

a great website by the way and has

millions of visitors all over the world

136 million visits per month so you can

maybe get some traffic and clicks

without even promoting you can see here

my profile I have around 1.3 followers

on medium and I almost post every single

week you can see this one it's a day ago

so you can create a blog for free on

medium and start publishing these

tutorials on medium and if you can

combine creating articles with YouTube

videos it will be a great idea for

example if you go here to my YouTube

channel and if you are following me from

the last two three years you may notice

that I promote a lot of affiliate

programs especially VPS services for

example let's open any website like this

one how to use AI to get traffic you

will see here I am promoting a service

called phrase so you can simply create a

tutorial on YouTube and add your

affiliate branded link under your video

so this is about creating tutorials it's

one of the most important strategies and

if you can do something called VPS

comparison it will be a great idea also

you can see compare VPS performance for

example you pick two services like

digitalocean and Walter and you do a

comparison between them and you publish

this comparison like a study it's very

important let's now move on strategy

number three to promote with special

keywords here we are still in tutorials

and creating content but I want to

mention something about special keywords

if you go here down on this slide that

you will get you will see we have these

kinds of keywords best cheap

Alternatives compare improve offer

discount this list will give you more

ideas on what type of tutorials and

articles and content you need to create

to promote Walter and similar services

like the best WordPress hosting like the

best VPS service the best cheap VPS

Service Alternatives like Google Cloud

Alternatives comparison as I told you

before improve your performance with

Walter VPS offers get hundred dollars

free credit on vulture promo codes

coupon codes all these keywords special

keywords will help you craft ideas to

promote Walter VPS service let's move

now to strategy number four which is

quora one of the best strategies by the

way if you open quora.com and if you

know quora which is a website where you

can answer questions and get some

traffic I wanted to tell you go and

answer 50 questions per week on the

questions per week no you can answer

simply one or two questions or maybe

five questions per week and you can

really get a lot of traffic and

awareness from quora for example what we

can do simply is go here and search for

a topic let's say digital marketing

anything and make sure to select the

topic digital marketing and you can

simply click on most viewed writers like

this one this person here and follow him

and see what questions he's answering in

this way you can answer the best

questions other trick in quora go here

to your profile section click on ads

manager I'm not talking here about

running ads please Focus click on new

campaign anything now test then anything

generic budget hundred dollars anything

and click on continue what you want to

do here is go to questions and let's say

VPS and simply click on bulk add and

then search for VPS for example in our

topic click continue now quora will show

you the top questions with weekly views

like this question is getting around 200

to 350 views per week let's go back and

let's pick another topic let's say

health anything now just to show you an

example of what we can do here continue

and you can see this question gets 3500

views per week and this way you can

discover questions to answer on quora

pick the right questions and you can get

a lot of traffic and awareness from

quora don't just answer randomly let's

go back and do this for example email

marketing continue let's say we got this

question here other trick is when you

open the question if you click on view

question log you will see more stats

like how many views this got how many

followers are following this question so

if we have a lot of followers it's a

very good question to answer people will

get announced when someone answers this

question so for quora simplify and high

volume questions answer one two

questions a day maybe one it's enough

and start adding links after around 10

days if you are new on Cola build your

profile then start add links and follow

the 370 percentage formula which is

adding links in 30 percent of your

answers and it's very important to

create a small landing page when you

paste your link on Coda and by the way

on link here if you go back to link.me

let's open link we have something called

Splash Pages which is a free feature

inside link you can create a small

landing page for free to promote any

affiliate product you want anyway so

this is strategy number four now and

number five is an advanced secret method

really to promote such Services Like

Walter I'll talk about in a little bit

before I go the secret method I want to

talk about scaling the strategy so now

we finish step number four almost we

have our step number five how to reach

one thousand dollars per month so

scaling is about simply two things

creating more content to promote and

plan your content marketing strategy so

it's about promoting the content more

and more to get and build more more

audience like building an email list

building followers on social media

building maybe a YouTube channel

subscribers and so on building a full

content Market strategy I know this may

require a full course I can't mention

right now but I believe I have a video

here one video can help you with this

it's called a traffic explosion method

how to explore your content all over the

Internet you can check this video in the

description below other thing I want to

mention in scaling is to promote

multiple VPS Services as I told you we

have digital option you can also join

their program we have live node other

service you can also give credits and

make money with referrals you can

promote other web hosting Services you

can maybe create a full website just

about web hosting service and VPS

Services show the cones and pros of

every service review them compare them

create studies about them this is a full

business idea as a website at ion VPS

Services you can scale in this way and

by the way I have a full tutorial coming

soon on my Channel about creating a

niche website around one product which

is very important I'm doing it right now

a full case study I will share with you

maybe next month in a full guide like

this one so don't forget to

Notifications to get every new update

now it's time for the advanced secret

method to promote VPS Services Like

Walter it's about building a VPS advisor

tool what do I mean by this let me give

you an example this website

hostadvice.com build this simple tool

web hosting advisor here you can go the

wizard like what kind of site you want

plan Blog then what CMS you want to use

and so on so it's a small tool it's a

wizard where people will fill and at the

end they will suggest the best hosting

for you based on your input you can see

it's loading now so they told you use

this service and of course this is an

affiliate link here so you can build

similar tools as is called the VPS

advisor tool so people will fill a small

form and you will advise the best VPS

service based on their input and the

result will be an affiliate link this is

very important and if you want to learn

this in detail how I did this other case

study with full details how I use tools

to automate affiliate links and make

money on autopilot you can check my full

case study here in this video I hope you

enjoyed this guide if you have any

upcoming videos

"
18,Misleading,"hi friends today i will share with you

one of the easiest ways someone can make

money online well i say easiest i don't

mean you will get rich in one month no

but why it's easy simply because we

don't need to write articles and blogs

we don't need to wait for google to

approve our site like after two or three

months we don't need a lot of traffic as

you'll see right now anyone can do it if

you're a beginner expert anyone from

anywhere on this planet you can do it

and you may see your profits maybe next

week again i'm not promising you to be

rich next month or make 1 000 per day i

want to be honest here let me share with

you my numbers what i achieved with my

case study to have an idea what to

expect on the website i built i got

around 3 000 visits or users per month

the last 28 days and these are my

earnings around 100

dollars but honestly i didn't work more

than 15 hours on this strategy so i

believe 150 dollars for 15 hours for 4

000 or 3 000 visitors is good numbers

especially for beginners what if you can

get more than that so this is a start

point and you can scale maybe two

thousand dollars per month two thousand

dollars per month and so on if you work

consistently like three hours a day or

four hours a day following this strategy

but please do me one favor watch this

video till the end as i will mention a

lot of tricks and tips and things that

help me succeed with this strategy so

without wasting more time let's start

with step number one we need to create a

website not a blog we don't have content

please follow up the idea is somehow new

special and do a lot of interesting

things in this video so we need web

hosting and one of the best services

really i searched a lot one of the best

services is hostinger i think it's the

best affordable web hosting for everyone

gigabytes of storage we get a free

business email ultimate bandwidth free

ssl cloud floor protection weekly

backups free domain and don't forget the

support 24 7 almost 100 uptime 30 days

money back guarantee all these for

really an awesome affordable pricing you

can see here they are running a sale for

three dollars per month all these for

three dollars per month i will select

this premium shared hosting plan to

start so select and what's nice also

about hostinger that you can pay with

anything you want credit cards paypal

google pay alipay and even

cryptocurrency so you can pay with

whatever service you want and don't

forget to enter the coupon code click on

this link here have a coupon and write

down h educate my special coupon for you

to get an extra discount click apply

and that's it or you can simply use my

direct link in description below to get

this direct discount so create your

account get a hosting account and then

log in to your account so this is my

premium shared hosting from hostinger

let's start and set up the web hosting

start i will skip this wizard and let's

build a new website select then i will

select other it's not a wordpress

website we don't have a blog here we are

going to create something else you will

see right now simply here click start

from scratch and now you need to select

a domain name now we have two options

existing domain and a new domain since

the plan allows you to create a new

domain for free please go with a new

domain because we have a trick about the

domain name i will tell you about it in

a little bit click on select now and you

need to search for a domain name to add

to host tinker now in my case i have

adobe i will select existing domain i

will enter my domain name as i told you

please in your case don't do this select

a new domain and wait please to the end

of the video because i will mention an

important tip to succeed with this

strategy so continue finish set up now

just wait a couple of minutes for

hosting to manage everything for you

it's automated and this is our hosting

panel or dashboard here you can host

website install add your email accounts

your business emails manage your domains

everything install wordpress and so on

really great dashboard by the way so

after we get the hosting we finished

step one now we are ready to understand

the concept what we are going to do with

this hosting what we are going to do

anyway in this strategy let's so the

idea simply is about building a website

not any website a tools website and they

will show you now what i mean exactly by

a tools website it will be a free tool

where anyone can use it but the trick is

that this tool will be automated in a

way when users uses this tool you'll

make commissions let me show you one

example my example open your browser and

go to fastdomainer.com

this website i created in like one hour

you will see how right now this website

is a tools website where people can

search for domain name availability here

so for example you will want to create a

website and you want to search for a

domain name so you go here and say my

domain whatever you write a keyword and

you search in one click this tool will

tell you if this domain is available

registered or not and will give you a

lot of suggestions if it's not available

it will be in red it's available it will

be in green and people can click on buy

to buy this domain directly from my

website but when they click on buy look

what happens they will go directly to a

website called name silo one of the top

websites to sell domain names and they

will buy through this website but you

can see here it's an affiliate link and

all this is automated so people are

using a tool that helps them in

something then in some way affiliate

links are automatically inserted and

automated in this website in a little

bit i will show you a lot of other

examples of course not everyone here

will copy exactly the same website and

do exactly the same operation no i will

give you several ideas now on how to

apply this technique maybe another niche

in your website please some patience a

lot of value is coming soon in this

video so how i did this you may tell me

now okay i'm not a developer i can try

code or create such websites will take a

lot of time and so on let me show you

how exactly i did this and by the way

this name silo just to show you again my

earnings in this account this is my

affiliate program manager and this is my

earnings here total commissions and

pending commissions so let me show you

how i created this website simply in

code canyon php script if you search

here for domain you will find this

script domain skit let's open it and go

to live preview you will see now this is

the script it's ready this is the script

and this is my website i just changed

the logo some colors and so on to make

my own branding add some links and so on

it's easy by the way so what i did is i

bought this script you can see i bought

the license 35 dollars only i bought it

and i hosted online i got some traffic

as you saw let's go back here to google

analytics this fast domainer the last 28

days 3 000 users not too much and i got

some earnings and this is how it works

again not everyone here watching this

video will go and buy this script

exactly and host it and start you can do

this maybe but in a little bit i will

show you other examples and ideas i

believe it's really interesting that you

can apply and make way more than that

because you are going to use different

strategy and different techniques and

different affiliate programs so when you

download a script or you create a script

whatever you do if you click download

now you will see this is the folder if

you operate at extract you will see we

have this upload file this is the file

we are going to upload to host finger to

our panel so we can launch our website

but before we do this and host the

website let me share with you the first

trick for today if you notice the name

of this domain is fast domainer it

contains this keyword domain if you go

to google now and search for this

keyword you will see it has around 300

or 400 searches per month and my website

is ranking on top of google for this

keyword so if you can find a target

keyword domain for your website it will

be a great idea for other example if you

go to seo analyzer dot m e you see this

is a website analyze your seo it's a

free tool also it's for me it contains

this keyword seo analyzer if you go here

and search for this seo analyzer you

will see that my website is on top of

google to be honest with you i'm not 100

sure that if you select a keyword in

this way it will help you rank on top of

google directly but i think in my

experience in the experiments i did it's

working for this website for fast

domainer and now i got another keyword

which is large file sender.com also i

bought a script for this domain if you

go here and search for large file sender

you will see it's getting around 5 400

search per month by the way i installed

this website today so i expect to rank

next month with this keyword i will keep

you updated don't forget the

notifications and check my commit

section for all results and updates so

how to do this simply we can use tools

like eat super tools here go to keyword

research it's a free tool you can use to

search for keywords and check search

volume or you can use ubersuggest also

you can use also for free you can go

here to keywords keyword ideas and then

write a couple of keywords for example

in my case domainer again

large file sender and you will get the

search volume data per month you'll get

your difficulty and then when you find a

certain keyword you just copy it and go

to services like fast domainer for

example and search and see if this is

available or not or you can simply use

another service called instant domain

search and search for this domain i took

it so it's not available and you can

start searching here for domain

containing target keywords that you can

rank for on google i hope you got the

idea so this is about the domain name if

you find something with a keyword get it

and buy it inside hostinger for free you

have a free domain in the account now

let's do a demo and install the script

inside hostinger host it and run the

website simply inside hosting your

account go here to file manager and

inside the public html folder i will

upload the script file that i bought

from code canyon this script by the way

whenever you download a script from

codecanyon usually we have a

documentation and you can see the

installation is somehow simple we just

need to upload this zip file extract it

and create a simple database i will go

here and click on upload a file here we

are

upload just wait a little bit

then i will say unarchive to extract it

and here we are we extract the files

let's see what's next then it will tell

you to go to the installation page so

open a web browser then slash install

and here we are we are almost

requirements then the license you need

to enter a partial code simply go here

to code canyon and

in the downloads page beside any file

you can see here the license code you

just open it and copy the license

process code and then use it here and

continue the setup so we need to create

a database go here in hosting again and

then click on my sql databases and let's

create some database db1 anything user1

and a password and create

and now you can use this database inside

your installation i don't want to waste

a lot of time in the installation

because a lot of you may be using

something else simply any script you

download from here it will have a

documentation you can follow it and if

you need help i'll be here to help you

and also you can join us on discord with

a membership so i want to focus now on

the second important idea for today that

will help you succeed with this strategy

which is giving you other ideas other

than this domain search i will help you

with the ideas what we can build in

different niches by the way we still

have two things for today the ideas and

predict which is the best product for

them to buy so they will go through a

wizard and then you will show them the

right products for them to buy i will

developer you can build your own idea as

i did for age super tools and other

websites so this is the first topic now

let's move to the most important topic

for today which is getting traffic how

we can promote this website okay i built

this but how when you create a tools

website like this one we don't have

content we don't have a blog how to

promote it how to get 3000 visitors per

month which is not that big number

before this the first thing you have to

do is to add your website to google

analytics and google search console so

go here search for google search console

open the first link start now sign in if

you don't have an account and simply

click here add a property and add your

website inside google search account so

for example this is my website you are

going to go here continue and then

simply it needs to verify this so you

have different methods to verify the

html file is the easiest just download

this file and then go again to hostinger

your dashboard and then go to file

manager again we are here the file

manager and simply upload this file that

google gave you

and here we are then you can simply

click on verify and we are done

ownership verified now google will start

indexing your website to show it on

google search results again go ahead to

google analytics and add your website to

track your another text also i have a

gift for you you can go here to

we are monitoring and tracking our

website now we can start getting traffic

you special tricks in quora if you go to

coral.com the first thing you have to do

is to create a website and optimize your

profile make sure to make it clean

choose an image and so on now how to get

traffic from cora is to target the right

questions the first method is to search

for your niche let's say in my case

digital marketing and then click on the

topic digital marketing and then go here

to most viewed writers and you will see

here the top writers in this niche and

follow them and see what questions they

are answering so you can speak the top

answers following these top writers on

kora in your niche the second method is

when you search for questions on kora

manually go here to questions let's say

you open this question what are the

metrics you have to check on kora the

number of follows and the number of

answers for this question if you have a

lot of followers go and answer this

question also you can click on these

three points and click on the question

log to see more stats like how many

followers how many views is it updated

like three hours ago we have a follow so

find questions with a lot of followers

with a few questions follow up top

prices on cora and replicate their work

see what questions they are picking to

answer to get the best out of cobra the

second way to get traffic is to engage

in forums like credit and other forums

you can go to websites like find a

forum.net i think and click here in the

forum niches and check a forum in your

niche and start engaging in this place

to get traffic the third way i think you

know it if not spread the word on social

media create a twitter account facebook

account pinterest all these social media

accounts create them and always share

content to let people know about your

tool also you can use some paid ads if

you have a budget like google display

ads to do some brand awareness and to

get some traffic to your website let me

share with you now what i'm trying to do

to get more traffic on this website what

i did is simply i created a small blog

only three articles i picked specific

targeted keywords like how to buy a

domain name this keyword and i'm trying

to rank on top of google with this

keyword on this blog so i can also rank

these two three blog posts and get some

traffic so

seo is also a good method to rank your

website and get free organic traffic

from google and don't forget if you

create something like this you can add

also banner ads like this one these

banner ads are also affiliate links you

19,Misleading,"Let's say you have a list of 1000 email addresses

And you sell a product for just ten dollars

And your conversion rate is only one percent

You can simply earn a hundred dollars in a few minutes by sending a single email

Now let's imagine that you have 100,000 email addresses on your list.

The price of your products is fifty dollars or one hundred dollars

And your conversion rate is around two to three percent.

Imagine the number you can get by sending an email marketing campaign

Today in this course I will show you how to make money step by step through emails

Think of it as the ultimate guide to email marketing

Some people think emails are dead today in 2022

Simple answer is the best marketing strategy

To get more visitors and grow your business

And to earn more money online

keep watching

Hello everyone, Emma Hasan from H-educate

And you are watching the tenth part of our wonderful new series

Create an online business from scratch with me

To get to 2000 per month

If you follow along, you know that we built our website and learned a lot

About getting visitors, writing blog posts, and more

Today you will see how we can harness the power of emails to grow our business

Earn money online and get more visits to our website

This is my website I built with you embounce.com

About Email Marketing and Email Validation

Three articles have been published so far

I hope you accompany us

Because in six months we will see our first recipe

And I'm doing my best to get to $2000 before December 2022

So anyway, without wasting any more time

What do we have today?

The first step we need to understand the email marketing system

How it works

Of course, we're not talking spam here.

Talking about a true email marketing strategy

Build a real audience, build a real business and make real money

The idea is simple, now we have a website and we are building our business

While we are building our business and website, we need to build our audience.

One of the best ways is to build an email list.

is to have a contact list

Where you can contact them anytime to get more visits

To get more sales, maybe connect with them to ask questions or do surveys and anything

So what am I going to do now in this video

I will show you step by step how to build your email list

Attracting customers, how to get started and everything in between

Let me give you the example and then let's apply it

Here I will go to my website H-educate.com

My current site, I will open a sample page to show an example

You can see here that I am giving away some free e-books

If someone now clicks that download button

A popup form will open

He will tell you to download this e-book

You have to enter your name and email and click download

What's happening here is that I'm collecting these email addresses

Create my own email list

to simplify things

When you want to build an email list, you want to offer something

And in return you can get anyone's email address

This thing you offer is called an attractive magnet

What is the thing that attracts people to sign up for your email list

So the first step is to build something attractive

You need to create something that you will give people in exchange for their email addresses.

Let's do it now in this video

The second step is for you to build your email lists.

So the third step is to simply send campaigns

Let's see and do it step by step now

The main can be anything

If you follow here on my channel maybe 1 year or 16 months ago I posted this case study

Lead Generation Course How I Built a List of 10,000 Emails in 1 Month

A year ago I showed that when I created this application

super email sender

I used this app as a magnet

But an attractive magnet can be just about anything.

Free ebook, app, course or video

Or anything of value you can offer people

So I think the easiest magnet you can create is a free mini ebook

how much? Just go to canva.com

If you're following me, you know I use canva, it's one of the best apps on the internet

Go here to create a design and click here and write a book here

Then click on the book cover

And it will give you the ebook size automatically

And you can start creating a free ebook

Now here you have two options

They are creating a free ebook or magnet from scratch

create your own book

Or you can go to the PLR ​​sites

If you go here and type PLR ​​sites

And let's go to PLRproducts freePLRdownloads

We have many products

And by the way you can see my website in the foreground here

  18 top PLR sites

You can open this article to see the 18 best PLR sites

You can get free stuff with him

What are PLR ​​Sites?

They are simply sites where you can get PLR products

What is a PLR?

They are simply products that you can reuse

As an example, let's move here to this site

Go here for ""free ebooks""

You will find many things here

Say for example ""Google Analytics 101""

It is a free e-book that you can download absolutely free of charge and you have the right to use

But as a little tip when you download an eBook, don't use it as is.

Just make some changes or import them into canva

Or copy and paste into Microsoft Word PowerPoint or whatever you want and make some changes to it

Anyway, in my case what I did was write a small article on my blog here

In all posts about how to warm up an SMTP server

Forget it now, just focus on the idea

I will use this article to turn it into a free ebook

I'll click preview here so I can easily copy the text

let's start copying

ctrl + c then go here

I'll add a page and then just paste it

Just resize like this

write line 24

So we have this first part, let's say 32

after a decade

You can also get pictures if you want

Save the image to your desktop

Go here and add space

And we can go to the download section to download the media

and load the image

So this is the first page of the e-book

And you can just add anything like text or anything

I will say here embounce.com

So this is the first page of the e-book

In the same way you can copy the whole article of course not my article I mean your article

Or any magnet you build and create with canva

Now to save time I'm going to do a magic to finish the e-book on canva

One two Three

Now I have a ten page e-book

Excellent we still have the cover

Let's create a cool and attractive cover

The cool thing about canva is that we have a lot of templates here

We can choose between them, let's see what we have

I will choose this

I'll change the name and put my name here

What is the title of the ebook

OK

I will say here embounce.com

You can change this image if you want

Let's see what we have in the items

Email

let's download this

and here we are

I created a free ebook using canva based on the article

I also told you if you don't have an article and if you want something free and fast

You can access PLR websites.

Download free ebooks

Please enter your pledge

I think the idea is very simple

So now we have our own attractive magnet

Let's download in pdf

And by the way, you don't need a screen to do this.

You can do this with PowerPoint with Microsoft Word

or whatever you want

I think canva is quite easy and that's why I use it

So now we have this pdf file

And this is a free ebook that we can use as a magnet

So we finish the first step

We have the magnet and now we can give it to people

To start building our email list

let's see how

But wait a minute, before we start collecting email addresses.

When we collect these email addresses, we want to save them somewhere

We want something to manage our email list

We need an email marketing service

If you follow me on my channel I already explained Getresponse and convertkit

I explained many services

And last week I did a lot of research to find something you can get started with absolutely free.

Ex

As promised, I will do my best to find free services and free tools to start this business.

'Cause I know a lot of you can't put a lot of money into this

So one of the best free email marketing services

And building mail funnels is systeme.io

If you go here for prices

You will see that we have a free plan

Allows you to have up to 2,000 contacts

I think this is the only service that lets you add 2000 contacts absolutely for free

Unlimited emails can be sent

You can create sales funnels

Email campaign automation posts and rules

It's all in the free plan

So go now and get started for free with systeme.io

Already registered if you don't have an account just go and register

You will find a link in the description if you want

And you can see I deleted everything on this panel

'Cause I want to start with you from scratch

I don't have any contact

Today I will start building my email list with you guys in this new business

This service will allow you to manage your contacts

To build a sales funnel, send email newsletters and more

Usually when you want to collect and build an email list we have two main methods

The first is to create a funnel

A landing page that will be used to collect these email addresses

And you will do it now

The second method is while someone is reading your articles on your website.

As I showed before, a popup will appear where people can enter their email addresses

To follow you or to get your magnet and so on

Let's now implement these two methods

Let's start with the first method which is to create a custom landing page

Just go here for the conversion paths in systeme.io

Create a new sales funnel

In the objective here I choose to build an audience

We're just here to build an email list, to build an audience.

we will not sell anything

We'll call it here Create an Embounce Audience

Create and now it will create the funnel for you

You can see the compression page

The squeeze page is the first step where people will enter their email addresses

And on the thank you page you will tell people thanks for signing up or so on

Or direct them to a specific page

Anyway let's do it now squeeze page we have a lot of templates here

So we provide an e-book here so here we have this landing page

Let's take a look, you can see

We can add the e-book photo here in the blank space here

This is their address, first name and email and they can download the ebook here

So what we are going to do is select this model

So we can modify this

Click on Edit Page, now we will have the Page Editor

It's very simple by the way

We have this sample image and we are going to change it for the cover of our ebook

I will return here to canva.com for the ebook download page

I go here click download

And here I will choose png

Just select the first page and download

Now I will go back to the editor and I will simply upload my photos

In downloads, here is the image insert and you can see the image here

Let's change the background color to something brighter like this

And let's copy the address from here

and paste here

Enter your name to get this free e-book.

First name then download now

That's it, save your changes

let's go back to the system

Now we create a squeeze page

You see how simple it is you can add the url if you want

By the way, you can add your own website

If you access your account settings here

You will see that we have dedicated websites

We can add our custom domain here

Add a website, I'll say funnel.embounce.com

I will use a subdomain

Save and now you need to configure your dns

I will move here to my sites, to ambush

for DNS settings

We want to validate the site with systeme.io

So I'll copy this and move here

To add a Cname pointing to this address

I will copy the funnel

and paste here

and save it and again add another Cname

copy this

and paste here

Copy and paste here and save

And don't forget that I always remind you, if you have any questions or something unclear

I'll be here almost every day on Telegram and on the forum waiting for your questions

So go now and join us at H-educate.com/forums

On Telegram you will find the link in the description below

Then we add cname records

Now you need to wait a while until the verification is completed

Anyway, let's get back to work

So you can change your location if you want

I will write here Embouncefunnel and then save

So this is the squeeze page

So we have a thank you page

let's see what we have here

Let's see it

It's all set now, thanks for signing up

And you can add a link to your Facebook group

As this model shows

Maybe for your youtube channel and whatever you want

I don't want to waste too much time here

I think you get the idea. You can experiment and create your own designs and implement them

Now the main idea is on the click here page

In the rules of automation

When someone signs up, you need to add them to your contact list and tag them

So here in the automation rules go and add a rule

Click ""Subscription Email Path""

Add an action and I'll add a tag

What is the tag? It is simply something that describes the contact

You can see here you can choose a sign

So let's create a tag I'll go to the contacts here

Then for the tags

Add a new tag and I'll call it Preparing your list of prospects

As an example to let me know this contact signed up using this magnet

Come back here and refresh this page

I'll move on to the automation rules

Add an action and then add a tag

I would choose the magnet

So when someone signs up for this form, I'll tag them

So I need to send the magnet of attraction to this contact

You can do this on the thank you page

For example, when you specify this

You can edit this and join the facebook group here

You can say ""Download your e-book""

As an example and this url will be the url of your e-book

So you can just go here to google drive

And let's download our e-book

This is the e-book in pdf format

ok then share

I'll say change it with whoever has the link

You can see it, so copy the link

Then go here again to systeme.io

and paste the url, it's that simple

Now when someone signs up they will receive the e-book

And you will have the email in your email list

Let's test this, I'll open this page

I will enter my name and my gmail account and download now

We are ready Download your e-book

We can see now that I have an e-book

And if we come back here

In systeme.io under contacts you will now see that my email is registered

And this is the sign, you can see it

I was tagged with this tag

So it's so simple now that we have our first mail route

We may use it to collect email addresses

The main question now is how are we going to promote this email route?

That's ok, but now you can get this title, it's completely free

You can use it to promote this ebook and start collecting mailing addresses

You can promote this on your website

Or wherever you want to build your audience

Now the second way is to create a popup signup form

While someone is reading it will appear and the email can be collected

how do you do let's see

Go back to Funis here

I will create a new mail path

Create, build an audience

Now you can select the location You can see it, I checked the location

I will select this site

Example of a popup

accumulate

Now here I will delete the squeeze page, confirm

I will create a new step and call it popup

And in type make sure you select a popup form

Save and check this form before the thank you page

And you can see now that we have a lot of models too

I will choose this

Select it and again you can edit that, edit the page and anything

Get this free ebook

I don't want to repeat it now again, the idea is just to change this form and then save the changes

Go back to the system and now what you are going to do is go to the script

And copy this little text back to your blog

I'm going through the posts here just to show you how to do this

Let's say you want this popup to appear while someone is reading this article

Click Edit and now scroll down here to the end of the article

I will add a new block

I will choose html

Then type and paste the script here

Update and now we will show the post

Open up, see what happens now

While someone is scrolling and reading this article

This popup will appear

Users can sign up and get the free ebook in this popup

they can close like this

So this is how you can implement both a squeeze page like this

Or a popup form with Systeme.io absolutely free

And add it to your website

So we finish the second stage

What is the main step on how to build email lists

The third step is to start sending email marketing campaigns

You can go here for newsletters or advertising campaigns

And start sending to your contact list

So now let's dig a little deeper and talk about some more advanced tips.

What will help you when creating your campaigns, email lists and much more

So if you follow me you know I use a service called convertkit

It is one of the best email marketing services

Also, convertkit has a free plan

You can start with zero dollars up to 300 subscribers

What's the idea?

Go to my dashboard in convertkit

You can see my email list has around 4200 contacts

my average opening is 45%

The average click through rate is 12%

Not bad, now I'm going to show you how to create a custom popup form

To collect email addresses within convertkit

In case you want to use a slightly advanced method on your website

This is not mandatory, but I must make this clear to get the most out of this course.

So I'm going back here to the site I'm building with you

In this series embounce.com

I will go to plugins and add a new plugin

This time we have a paid plugin

It's optional but I use this plugin and it's great

That's why I'm sharing it with you

If you return to my website H-educate.com

You can see it's called Master Popsup

And the cool thing about Master Popsup is that you can buy it from Code canyon. It's a one-time payment

$39 if you can buy it go buy it

If you can't, fine.

I already bought this and I will download this plugin

To install on my site

Anyway, follow us, you will learn a lot of tips now

that you can later implement on your website

This is the compressed file. Let's go back to my website

And we load a plugin, choose the file

Click here to install now

By the way, some of you asked me about this SMTP mailing plugin error

We will fix it in the next video

So don't worry about it now

And don't forget if you have any questions or anything else I'm active almost every day on Telegram

And on the forum, go now and join us

Let's talk and help each other

So the plugin has been successfully installed and I will activate the plugin now

Very cool Master Popup

Go here for general settings to enter license

So this warning will show here

Click here, go to activate plugin here

It is not activated. Enter your username in envato

What is your username in code canyon

In the purchase code I will go here for my downloads

So here download the license file

Then I will copy the purchase code

Then go here and paste and validate your purchase

Sorry, I failed simply because I already used this license on my other site

Anyway, that's fine, I'll show you how to do it on my current site in H-educate

The first thing you need to do is connect Master-Popsup to your email marketing service

So if you go to general settings again

You will see that we have many services, up to 51 services

So whatever email marketing service you use, you can plug it into this great software.

And you can see here that convertkit is already built in and you can connect mailchimp

Up Mailster Up mailwizz e mautic

If you follow my email marketing videos

You know I've talked about many of these services before

Just click on the service you want to integrate

Then you need to copy and paste the api key

Now in convertkit in your account if you go here in settings

Then advanced options, you will see the api key here

Just copy and paste inside this field, inside Master Popsup

And are you ready like this

So we connect Master Popsup to our Email Marketing Service

Now go here and click on new popup

I won't go into details now.

I want to give an overview if you want to use this service or this program

You can do this and it's quite easy.

The first thing you need to add is the title, let's call it ""sample popup""

Then go here for ""Popup Templates""

You will find many ready-made templates

So pick one, I pick this one and then import

To accept

Let's go back to the general options

And now you can see that this is the form that appears

You can edit the photo, name, email and whatever you want

So what you need to do is go here to form the form

So in the audience list you just need to select the one inside the convertkit you created here inside the Master Popsup

The idea is quite simple

Maybe 10-15 minutes of using this plugin

It will allow you to create and test your first popup

I don't want to waste too much time on this as I've indicated that it's optional, it's quite advanced

not needed at this time

And by the way, it has a content blocking page if you like cpa marketing

You know I think the contents closet

Let's move on now and see how we can send a campaign

Let's go back to convertkit to watch this live now

We can click ""Send"" here

""Podcasts"" to send podcasts to all your contacts

Click New Podcasts

You need to enter a subject line

The cool thing about convertkit is that it has a feature called split test aeb

If you click on it, you can use two subject lines

And send the campaign with two subject lines to see which works best

So you can improve your campaigns with the best subject line later

So you just add the content here

You can see the auto-generated unsubscribe and profile update link here

So now the big question you might be asking is how to write good email copy

Now, to help you out, I can't start a full-text writing course right now.

In this video I will give you some templates

So if you go to H-educate.com/fourums

In the Email Marketing section you will see something called Email Templates

My team and I will publish some ready-made email templates for you

Templates for cold emails, newsletters and more

You can just copy and paste it, change some words and send it with your campaigns

Within systeme.io you can simply go here to send emails and newsletters

Send Mouth

Let's log in again, create a newsletter

Write a subject line and you can use the visual editor or the classic editor

All you need to do is compose your message.

Again here is the text field and you can add whatever you want

Now inside systeme.io so far they don't have a and b split test

But I contacted the founder of systeme.io and he told me that this feature will be available soon on their platform

So if you are using systeme.io don't worry they will add this feature soon

Now, one of the main problems that every working person is email marketing faces.

It's an inbox problem

When sending a campaign, you will see a very low open rate or very low click-through rate

Which means your emails don't make it to your inbox

That's why I've published the ultimate complete guide to getting into your inbox

I will keep the link in the description below you can check out this complete guide

"
20,Misleading,"Last month I bought this site name for ten dollars

Today it is $1,418

In this video I will show you how you can make money online

By selling domain names

I will share with you my investment in the names of the sites

How to find the best names to invest in

I'm going to share with you some cool tools

Some popular topics you can explore

Which you can use now today to invest in selling domain names

And a lot of interest in a few minutes

keep watching

The first step is what is the domain name?

It's simply the name of your website

Like in my case H-educate.com is the name of my website

It's unique and it's mine, it's my own business

The idea is to go and buy a website name

Then resell it at a higher price

It's that simple

But the main problem is how to choose the names of the sites that you can sell at a higher price

What are the best names?

What are the main factors for choosing domain names

And more, let's see together

According to godaddy, one of the most expensive website names ever sold is Cars.com

Website sold for $872 million

Now to be honest with you I'm not looking for such big numbers

If you buy something for ten dollars and sell it for five thousand dollars or two thousand dollars that will be great

But you have to understand something

Sometimes you can buy a domain name for a dollar and sell it for a million dollars

If you keep an eye on trending topics and about what's going on in this world

Yes, you may discover such sites

So keep watching to understand how

Now before I go and show you how you can search and find website names

Just write these 6 factors on a piece of paper or save them to your computer

These are the six main factors that you should check

When you want to find a site name to resell later

Let's apply these 6 factors directly to a site you purchased two days ago

It's called adzout.com

I bought it for ten bucks two days ago now

According to godaddy algorithm it costs about 1300 dollars

You can see it here in the info

It is based on an algorithm that uses the data possessed by godaddy

So it is appreciated

Anyway so let's apply these six factors

Number one, it is always preferred to use short sites

As you can see Adzout.com

short site name

Can be saved, make sure that the site you want to buy and you want to choose is easy to save

Like this Adzout.com

It's simple and easy to use

trade mark

This domain can be used as a brand name

Of course yes, I got the idea from Outbrain

Content Advertising Marketing Company

So Adzout is a perfect fit for an ad network company

Promote advertising campaigns

Keywords, I have Advertisement as a keyword

An announcement, it's an announcement

Then the extension, always use .com .net .org

Or even .io or .ai depending on the specialization

So if you work in the field of artificial intelligence maybe .io or .ai is better

But overall, .com is one of the best

So always apply these 6 factors to any domain you want to buy and resell later

Now the big question about how to find locations

Again memorize these three words

Specialized, Common, and Pervasive

What do I mean let's see

The first service I will use is fastdomainer.com

Here you can enter a site name like metaads as an example

It will tell you if this site is registered or not

Will give some suggestions

It will show you if this field is available or not

If it appears in red it is not available

Green is available for purchase

The cool thing about this tool is our Website Generator Tool

If you go here and type metaads

You can specify the names of the sites you want like I will keep .io

You can see that we also have .us .us again that depends on the major

Someone might open a store in the US or the UK

So you have to do some research as I will show you now

.app might also be a good website extension

I will now keep the .com and .io then create

And you can see now that it will generate a lot of website names for you that you can check

Now you may ask me, how do I choose the best site

I'll tell you in a minute

The second tool or website is instantdomainsearch.com I think you know

Here you write something like meta ads

Once again it will generate some website names

It will tell you if it is available or not and so on

Now the third tool which is rather interesting

She is namelix.com

Type here Meta or any keyword you want

Let's say here Metaverse ads

This is common now then generate

And now this service based on artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will give you a lot of names

I will only choose short names

I only want short names because they are better

And now this service will once again show you some interesting brand names

Look at this Advertise.ly

adsian ADSTRIPE ADsummer

These are based on machine learning and artificial intelligence

You can have some ideas

Maybe for your own business or for website names

So you can choose something from here

Go back to Fastdomainer and create some names

or search for it

It is one of the best servers I use to generate brand names with keywords

So this is how you can think and create domain names

But how do you choose one

You have to choose him again based on these three words

Specialization and common and widespread What do I mean?

What is the specialty that is the subject?

Let's say you want to buy a website related to selling cars

So maybe it's carsstore.com

As an example let's see

carsstore.com

was taken

So number one is specialty

What topic are you searching for?

So combine it with the popular and the popular

I mean you have to find something that might be popular right now

So you can buy some website names in it

like metaverse

nfts and cryptocurrency is the thing that people are searching for now in the whole planet

What did he do?

If you go to my site names, if you go here

You can see that I bought this domain blockshein.com

Now you may ask me what is the idea behind this website name

I'll tell you, we have a website called shein

Or shein.com I think

It's a great online store

So I thought of something

Maybe one day, this big site this big brand

You'll want to create something on the blockchain

So I bought blocksthein

It's something I thought about

I may be wrong, but I think it's a good investment for the future

Maybe in five years from now or six years

You can see that I have a lot of websites here

If you go here you can see mtblg.com

What does this mean

You can see it costs about $1200 estimated

It's about metaverseblog.com

Maybe next year someone will want to use this domain as their metaverse blog

or like metawatching.com

It is related to the metaverse as well

mvbeginner.com

Do you know the website called wpbeginner.com

It is one of the best websites about learning WordPress

wpbeginner stands for wordpress beginner

So I bought mvbeginner which is metaversebeginner.com

I believe that in the future he will have a great opportunity to sell at a higher price

These are the things I searched for and tried my best to collect some metaverse related sites

This is a new technology

again nextmetaglobe

You can also see here that I think themetacap is also among the best investments I've made

You can also check out verifiedtube.com

I also have this one that I really like

powerofemails.com

An email marketing company might want to use it

Maybe a blog about email marketing so I bought this domain

So I bought about 15 websites this year as an investment

Based on the specialty I know

Mitverse, Email Marketing and Blogging

Things that I think will have a good chance soon in the future

So I can resell it at a higher price

Back to the common stuff

What you need to do if you just want to work in this field, sell websites

You have to master google trend

You can go to trending searches in google

Find out what people are searching for now

What is popular now

As the example of the United States, what is popular, let's see daily searches

Like this keyword here and this and this

So you can find some keywords

And use these keywords with these tools and website generator tool

مع instant domain search و namelix

To find some good buying opportunities for only ten dollars or sometimes less

For a dollar, or two, or eleven, and so on

To sell later at a higher price

Also you can use the popular section of youtube

You can go here to youtube.com/trending

And find popular videos with the same idea in google trend

So master the google trend

 youtube

And one thing you should know too Twitter is a great place to find what's trending or trending

If you go here to Twitter

Here is what is happening now

You can click show more and see what's happening around the world

What's trending on Twitter

What are the most popular hashtags?

You can also use this information to find some website names

I also use a tool called Exploding topics

But this tool is rather expensive

Again for example if you go here to Categories

Suppose in the field of cryptocurrency

In the past three months

I want to see what happened

It will show you the growth of these keywords in topics like mintable

Like ""Nft utilities""

And if you click here you will see that this keyword

Growing by about two thousand nine hundred percent

You can see this graph here

Show related topics

This is a great tool that will help you find trending and trending topics

Explore topics that will spread in the future

This is why it is so important to use reddit and Twitter

Find out what people are talking about

So you can predict what will happen

This is exactly what this site does

By the way, I do not sponsor this tool

I just use it and it's a great tool to find some topic opportunities and trending topics for the future

Now to help you and because I know many of you can't invest in such tools

I promised you before

Soon I think in February next month

In the forum here, in the H-educate forum

You will have a forum called trend, popular and widespread

Like every week or 10 days or so I'll post what's trending and trending

Based on this site, google, twitter, etc.

This way I can help you find trending topics

And the most frequently discussed topics in different fields

So you can use these keywords and topics in your own work

Perhaps in selling domain names or in something else in your own business

This is the best I can do

I think I deserve a like button for this

So I guess using these three words

These are the six factors

You can choose the right site to sell it at a higher price

Well, now that you have purchased these sites, how do you sell them and where do you display them

Simply if you are using godaddy you can simply click on offer for sale

Then you will automatically connect to a service called afternic

afternic

Then this great service that works with major web providers

 godaddy register.com domain.com enoum namecheap

can be inserted here

And sell it through their service

You can also use filppa.com to sell your sites

You can use Sedo.com

Or if you wish you can go to codecanyon.net to php scripts

Searching for selling sites

I'll put the link in the description below

You will find these four scripts

Where you can list your domain for sale

So if someone searches for the site it will open this script

Let's check it out, when you use this script with your site name

This small site will open

And you can enter it the estimated value

And if someone wants to make an offer, they can enter their name and email and view it

Then send them and you will receive an email about his offer to contact him

Well we have something called slippa

It is a clone of Flippa

So if you are also interested in building a business

Where people can insert their sites into your website

You can buy this script if you wish

You can go and read reviews and comments

You can build your own digital marketplace within, not five seconds as written

It takes like an hour I think

For hosting, hosting, setting things up, etc.

Build Your Own Website Selling Business

And also you can view your own sites

Well we have this service here follotrader

Where you can also buy and sell websites with this script

So if you are interested in starting this business or using your own scripts

You can also buy this from Code canyon

I think I have covered all the basic concepts that will help you get started with buying and selling websites

We still only have one thing that you might be interested in too

It's something called domain drop catching

Which simply monitors what we call the expiration date of websites

This is a website called expireddomains.net

You can go here and click here

And you will see a list of websites that have expired

It has been used before and is now expired, you can go and buy it

By the way, this is sometimes good for SEO

And sometimes to sell it as in our case

And sometimes to use it with ads

It's a different topic somehow

But we can also use expired sites

Or go now and look for sites that will expire

Keep an eye out for some sites that will expire soon

Go and buy it directly

Especially if it is something of value and the owner does not know this

You can buy and flip this site later and sell it to someone else for a higher price

Hope you enjoyed this video and got some benefit

21,Misleading,"in the next few minutes you will learn what is 
an api two methods to make money online with apis  

and then i will reveal some secret tips and tricks 
from my business and what i'm doing to make money  

with apis this video is so interesting 
you don't want to miss it keep watching

hi everyone i'm hasan from hdk if it's your first 
time here on my channel here i share with you  

real experience real case studies related 
to digital marketing online business and  

making money online if you are interested don't 
forget subscribe now to notifications to get  

every new update now to be honest with you this 
video is somehow an advanced level and has some  

technical concepts but i will try my best to make 
it super simple so let's start and see what is an  

api api stands for application programming 
interface but simply forget about these  

terms and let's give a nice example to make things 
easy let's go to facebook.com if you want to post  

something on facebook usually we click here on 
post and you write the post and then simply click  

post simple now what if you are a developer you 
are someone who are is coding an application  

and wants to post on facebook automatically 
from the application like creating an auto  

post software for facebook how you are going 
to do this simply you can use the facebook api  

so an api is that thing that stands between you as 
a developer and a service like facebook allows you  

to interact with the service in our case it allows 
you to interact with facebook and post from your  

own software programmatically let's give another 
example here's a tool called ubersuggest by nail  

patrol i think you know it if you are working 
online if you go here and sign in you will see  

that this tool allows you to continue with google 
to sign in with google so you are interacting with  

google how this happens simply using google api to 
sum things up an api is that thing that allows you  

to interact with a service let's give you an 
example from my own website if you go here to  

aidsupertools.com my free seo on digital marketing 
tools platform and let's say you want to search  

and find difficulty of a certain keyword you go 
here to seo keyword research tool and search for  

what is api example search and now the tool 
will give you these metrics the search volume  

difficulty and the cpc and whatever you can get 
this only by using my platform the website itself  

what if you want to access these metrics from 
your own application you simply need to ask me  

about the api so i develop an api to allow you 
access these metrics i hope you got the idea i  

tried my best to make it as simple as possible 
but anyway you can always join our telegram  

group to chat with me almost every single day 
i will be more than happy to help you or simply  

comment your questions below i'll try my best to 
answer them all so we finished the first part what  

is an api now how to make money with apis 
as i told you i will share with you two  

methods the first method is to create an api 
and sell it as an example i can create an api  

that will give the seo difficulty meter for any 
metric and i can sell this api to any developer  

now here we have two problems number one is how 
to develop it and number two is where to sell it  

let's solve a second problem fortunately we have a 
website called rapid api api.com allows you to buy  

apis and sell your api and if you go here to 
similar web extension you will see we have 1.4  

million visits per month so it's a trusted popular 
website where you can sell and buy apis if you  

go here and search for domain authority you will 
see now rapid api will show you a lot of results  

the first one is this api domain authority open 
it and you will see now it's by age educate i  

developed this and published it on rapid api five 
days ago you can see it's still new and if you go  

here to pricing you will see i am selling this api 
with this number of requests with these prices so  

if a developer wants to access my data or this api 
he will pay a monthly membership let's test this  

api you can go here down and say as an example 
google.com and say test endpoint you will see this  

api will get the domain pagerank domain authority 
and spam score so a lot of developers services  

wants to access such data and they can buy my api 
so we saw the second problem is where to sell the  

api and now the first problem is how to develop 
this api now in my case if you are following me  

you know i am from a programming background so 
i developed this api believe me in less than one  

hour it's super easy by the way i will show you 
the code now you can see here i have only one  

controller and this is the api code to get the 
domain metric and this is the function if you go  

here you can see this is my secret method to get 
the domain metric one method that's all if you  

have some basics in programming you know what i'm 
talking about it's super simple one call and one  

method and if you want me to reveal more secrets 
about this method how i get domain metrics go now  

comment this below and like the video if i get out 
of engagement i will reveal more and more secrets  

so i developed this how you can do this you have 
two choices number one is to learn this believe  

me you can learn this in less than one week and i 
can do this i can teach you this in one hour video  

on youtube if you want me to do this let me know 
also in the comments section below or simply can  

hire someone on websites like upwork or fiverr.com 
you can ask someone to develop an api for you and  

sell it on rapid api but the idea here is to find 
something interesting it will help developers so  

this is the first method on how to make money with 
apis the second method is to use apis and convert  

into an online tool if you go back to eight super 
tools if you are following me i mentioned that one  

of the best methods is to develop a tools website 
like my website here and last month i revealed one  

secret about the instagram hashtag tool i told you 
that i developed this based on rapid api if you go  

here to hash tag i used this api here i got it 
and translated it or converted it into this tool  

and now i'm monetizing it with google adsense 
and you can do the same if you want it's  

not that hard believe me i always repeat if you 
want to be successful online number one tip is to  

learn technical skills coding web hosting anything 
technical will help you to be successful online  

so let's reveal now another secret if you go to 
discover influencers you'll find that i developed  

this tool where you can find and discover 
influencer over the internet how i developed  

this let's go back to rapid api again and if 
you go here to influencer search you will see  

this api by social animal so i use this api and 
then i implemented and integrated in my website  

to develop this tool please i'm revealing a lot of 
secrets just give me a thumbs up it will help me  

help more people worldwide so the second method is 
to use apis from rapid apis or different websites  

and apis to build a tools website like this like 
me and monetize with google adsense maybe sell ad  

spaces affiliate marketing a lot more i talk about 
in my other videos you can review if you want i  

will leave some links in the description below if 
you want to check if you go here to my website you  

can see i'm getting every month around 300 000 
visits on my website this helps me not only to  

make money out of this website but also to grow 
my business i can promote anything i can build  

audience today we have around 80 000 signed 
up views you can see 80 000 happy users  

listed in my platform so this is very important 
to learn and to apply in your business if you  

want to grow and build something special in your 
business i know you like to see some numbers  

earnings and so on let's go to google adsense for 
example and break down for this month you will see  

that this month i made around two thousand one 
hundred dollars from google adsense from this  

website i talked about this in detail how i do 
this how much traffic you need how to implement  

everything in my full free course here on my 
channel i will leave the link in the description  

below now i want to mention a very important tip 
that you have to know whenever you work with api  

especially if you are working with apis from 
rapid api an example let's go back to hash tag  

apis let's click on hashtag the one i'm using 
and go here to pricing please focus very well  

let's say you got the ten dollars plan for 
250 requests per day as a beginner always  

always always cash the data whatever you get 
from the api save it in your database for two  

reasons number one if someone is searching for 
the same term multiple times in the same period  

you can get data from your database instead of 
requesting from the api so it can lower your cost  

and the other reason is you can develop new tools 
based on data let's review another secret if you  

go here to youtube topic explorer you will 
see that this tool will show you topics with  

high surge volume and low competition keywords 
that we can use in youtube to grow your channel  

how i am getting this data simply because i am 
saving and caching all data from the last year  

now i have millions and millions of records i can 
simply filter them and show it to you as a full  

tool to help youtubers please listen very well 
these are very important information that will  

help you whenever you are developing a business 
on line so always cache data and save data in your  

database when you work with api let's now move on 
to the last part of the video the general advice  

the advice for today is simply dedicate some 
time to learn technical skills we are in 2021  

come on instead of scrolling on instagram and 
facebook all the day watching netflix and wasting  

your time go to udemy.com coursera.org udacity.com 
edx even youtube go here and start learning we  

have a lot of free courses that you can learn from

"
22,Misleading,"In the next minutes

I will show you step by step

from scratch

How can you make your first $400 or $500, in the next 27 days

This video is a challenge not only for you, for me too

This video is probably one of the best videos I have posted here on my channel

What I'm going to show you works from any country and all over the world

You don't need a website

I don't need an audience

We'll start from scratch

 And what's really cool is that it's completely free

All the tools you will use are absolutely free

So you have no excuse

If you are ready, let's get started

Hi everyone I'm Hassan from h-educate

Today I am very happy to post this new amazing video

If this is your first time here on my channel

Post here videos about digital marketing and online business

real case studies

I think you will love my content

So don't forget to like the video and subscribe and let's get started together

Without wasting a single second

So

I don't want to explain the concepts

Let's go straight to my screen and start implementing our strategy today

Open your web browser

and go to system.io

 You will find the link in the description below

In any case

Why did you choose this application, this service

Simply because it's free forever

It does not require a credit card

So you have no excuse to start

Just go and subscribe

Now in my case, I have an account because I already started the strategy

 So I will login to my account

You can see that I have some data here because I started 2 days ago with this strategy

I am sharing with you a real live case study

Real strategy for real data

I'm testing it and challenging myself with you on this strategy

What is system.io

It's simply an automated marketing system

You can do it all in one place

Email Marketing and Building Sales Funnels 

Manage your contacts

And make the system automated, even creating blogs

Selling products and creating courses

It really is a great service

I tested it last week, it's really cool

It's completely free

Just sign up here and go to the conversion paths

So

We have now taken the first step

We now have a free account at system.io

The second step is to choose your major

And what specialty will you work in?

What is your topic about?

In my case I chose digital marketing, online business and affiliate marketing

It's my specialty, it's global

In your case, you can choose what you want

Or simply follow up with me in the same specialty

It's up to you

So what I did was create this little pdf file

Affiliate Toolkit

Please don't tell me you don't know how to write and so on

You will not write anything

Now you will see how easy it is to create something like this

 It's about 18 pages

Show some tools and services that help affiliate marketers

So the second step is you should create a toolkit like this

Now in my case, I simply use powerpoint

You can also use powerpoint as you can see

 It's on PowerPoint

I just created this small affiliate marketing toolkit

What is the toolkit?

It's not an e-book

We will not explain anything here

We only share Affiliate Tools in my case

Digital Marketers Tools

WordPress Tools

Tools for Online Marketers

Email Marketing Tools

Health and fitness resources

Resources and tools for financial services, etc.

So whatever your specialty, you should create a small toolkit like this one

Group the tools in your specialty and create a small toolkit like this one that you can see

Such a service here, l-ink.me

Then cb snooper for clickbank

then we have

headline analyzer , then we have canva and then we have grammarly

All of these are services and tools that help affiliate marketers manage their businesses

And get more sales

Like constant contact like Bluehost

All of these services help affiliate marketers

So you will create a toolkit like this

How do you do this, to make things easier for you

Just go to Google and search for example Wordpress Toolkit

 Let's move on to this

Wordpress Toolkit

 Let's say here ""Affiliate Toolkit""

Let's see this

Let's choose this, and this

We will have a lot of articles in the Internet that share resource tools for a particular specialty or topic

Like in this case about WordPress Toolkit

 You will see here

These are the tools mentioned

It helps people who work with Wordpress

You can just copy the same tools, same groups, same thing

And create a pdf or powerpoint file from these articles

Like this for affiliate marketers

I used these articles to create my collection, I've used them

You can see here Flippa ShareASell semrush Aherfs

All of these are tools that will help affiliate marketers

You can see other websites

So you collect tools and resources in a specific discipline

And you create these little affiliate products or this toolkit

In my case it's for affiliate marketing, as I told you it's up to you

You can follow along with me and create an affiliate marketing toolkit

Or simply use your specialty

It depends if you have a business or you are a beginner, I don't know

It depends on you

Just create a toolkit in a specific specialty

But after creating this toolkit, you need to be careful

What you will do is fill this toolkit with links

As in my case, suppose here

We have  Grammarly

This tool will help you while composing or writing emails or writing blog posts

It will help any affiliate marketer

If you hover over this link you will see that it is my short link

hy.me

If you've been following, you know these are my links, to my own work

Again here are my links

All of these links are affiliate links

So you will fill this toolkit with commission links

Maybe links to your website if you have one

The idea is to fill it with links, especially commission links

To follow these links

To track these links, it is best to use a link shortener

Now in my case if you are following me, you know that I am using my link shortener

called

l-ink.me

But l-ink.me is not free

Alternatively you can use bitly

It is a free link shortening service

You just need to shorten your links so you can track them

In my case you can see here all these

Affiliate Marketing Toolkit

All these are short links to follow links inside this pdf or affiliate toolkit

I get the idea

So you create a toolkit and fill it with links, commission links

So far I think the idea is fairly simple

We have created a mini e-book

We have registered with system.io

 We filled it with commission links

Now we are ready to start expanding, promoting and building our own money making machine

Our automated business

Now before we continue, you may ask me where I will get the commission links from

I'm a newbie and don't have any affiliate links yet

I explained this in detail on my channel

But it is enough to watch three videos on my channel

I posted maybe two of them last week

You can watch this

""Best Affiliate Programs for Beginners""

I have shown you some of the best programs for beginners that do not require approval

You can register and get the links directly

Or simply “Earn up to ten dollars per subscription

Using these 7 affiliate links or 7 affiliate programs

watch it

Then go down and watch this video

""How do I do affiliate marketing? My strategies""

It will help you a lot to understand how to get commission links, how to track them and much more

These 3 videos are enough for you to understand how to do affiliate marketing

Of course I have a lot of case studies here and educational videos

You can watch it if you want to learn more about affiliate marketing

Watch real case studies and real scenarios

In any case

We now have the set and the pdf file

This is our account at system.io

So what did you do

Please from now on you have to focus well

Because what I'm going to show you is very important

to stop

Before we continue, I have a little gift for you

 As l-ink.me mentioned is not free

It costs about $99 for lifetime use

In this video I will give the three of you full access to L-ink.me

If you are interested, just comment below that you are in this gift raffle

Not only that, in this video we have other interesting gifts

So stay with us and keep watching

And please do me a favor

If you found this video helpful so far and learned something new

Anything

Just hit the like button

This will help me develop my channel and reach more people around the world

let's continue

What you will do here is create a new path, in the Paths section

Click Create

Then click Create Audience

And let's call it Toolkit or whatever you can call Toolkit Paths

Click Create audience, creating

And now we have the conversion path

We have a squeeze page which is the main landing page

Where people can enter their email addresses

Get your own Affiliate Marketing Toolkit or Toolkit

Then a thank you page

Very beautiful

So here you can simply choose a template

We have a lot of templates, I'm using this

Click on ""Choose this""

basic

And here you can click Edit Page

We'll have the editor here

You can change this book page

In my case, I added this page here you will now see in a bit

Enter, just change this address

And keep everything like that

its enough

Then what you will do is go to the automation rules here

Let me show you my funnel, it will make things easier for you

Let's get back to the funnels here

This is my funnel case study

I started two days ago

You can see, let's open it

This is my toolkit and this is the action box here

Well, when someone clicks

Let's move on to the rules of automation

When someone subscribes to this form, what will happen

Is that I'm going to tag it with the Affiliate tag

Then I will email him to download the Affiliate Toolkit

very easy

So if you go to contacts

You will see that these email addresses are flagged as Affiliates

So I can categorize my contacts

 My Email Address List

 Let's go back to conversion paths again, to my funnel

Then they will go to the Thank You page

Then on the thank you page

In the rules of automation

I simply say enter this person this entity into the affiliate marketing campaign

You will see how this is very important now

Because if we go back to the email addresses

Then to campaigns

You'll see I also created a campaign

If you open it, you'll see I have eight emails inside

And I received and sent the first email, only two opened

 Opening rate is 5%, that's okay

So

You will also create a campaign

A series of emails that you will send to your contacts

For anyone involved

So how do you do it, just go to campaigns again

create

Call it eg testcamp now, or something

Save campaign

Then open this test campaign

And add an email

You can use the classic editor or the visual editor to create an email message

Add any subject line you want

suppose like this

construction

And you can edit the email like this

Add anything you want in the email, and save changes

Now, in the campaigns section, we will get

Testcamp

We have this email

Then add another message and so on

So create a list of emails

Which will be sent to your contacts automatically like every few days

As you can see here in my campaigns

In the campaign for my affiliate marketers that I launched

I have about eight emails that will be sent every two days

And in every email I have links to commission products

for my web pages

for my products

To anything you want or simply can give value

Give value to building trust with your audience with your contact list

Remember that so far I have about 100 Let's see how much you got in the stats

I have about 145 subscriptions

So in the past two days, in the past 48 hours

I built my own email list with 145 email addresses

The conversion rate was around 25%.

not bad

So I guess now you get the idea

And how to create this system

So to sum things up

Create a toolkit

Fill it with tools and commission links

 Go to system.io and sign up

And you create a funnel

 and a subscription page to collect email addresses

Then you create a campaign to send emails to your contacts

To build trust and relationship with your new contacts

And you will continue to build your email list

This way, you are promoting the toolkit

and give a value

It promotes affiliate links within a toolkit and within the messages you send

But not directly, always make sure to take them to the landing page

You can create them inside system.io

Or simply what's cool you can create a small blog here inside system.io

Create a blog

Look at this, ""Blog View""

You can create a microblog and also send users to your microblog within system.io

 It's completely free

He can do everything for free, just think about it

Think creatively and implement this great strategy

Now the main problem of course

The main question you are going to ask now

Well, this is the landing page

How do I get visitors to this landing page

How do I get people to see this page

To get their email addresses and create an email list

To answer this question, let's explain the strategy

Why did you say 27 days

Because I just gave you seven days

To understand the strategy

To implement them, to prepare your system

To create landing pages

To shorten links, to register for affiliate links, etc

You don't need more than seven days

After you create the system

And you have this system ready automatically

Just get visitors to this link here

From now on, the next 20 days are only about getting visitors

 You work every day for two hours just to get visitors

How do you get visitors?

I always repeat the same thing in every video

Everyone asks about visitors

And in my channel here I have a complete free course on getting visitors

Please go and watch it

It's a complete free course featuring all my strategies

So in the next 20 days try to get visitors

You can only use the free methods

Or you can pay for visitors if you want

as in my case

Yesterday, I tested individual udimi ads

I ordered 2 individual ads from these sellers

And I got about 300 or 570 clicks

Because in this challenge I don't want to use my audience

I don't want to use my website

I want to get visits from outside my republic

From outside my website

So from now on I will do my best to get visitors from pinterest and from Quora

And from all other visitor sources

We'll see next week

Then two weeks later until we reach 27 days

23,Misleading,"from any country without any special skills 
you can follow up today and learn how to make  

at least one thousand dollars per month under 
the drop servicing business model today i will  

show you what is drop servicing 
how it works how to implement it  

and how i do it and how i make 
one thousand dollars per month

hi everyone i'm hassan from hdk and you are 
watching a drop servicing ultimate guide step  

one let's see my dashboard you can see here in my 
wordpress website there's a date range from the  

last month my total sales is two thousand thirty 
four dollars i refresh the page just for those  

who like to see live proofs this is from the last 
month 2034 dollars with 19 orders wait a little  

bit i told you how to reach 1 000 and you see here 
2 000. you will understand this in a little bit  

just some patience so what is drop servicing 
if you go back here to my website the service  

page you will see here i am selling a lot of 
services so when someone buys a service from my  

website what i do simply is i hire a freelancer to 
do the task for me i sell this as an example for  

59 donors i pay the freelancer 20 dollars i earn 
29 and so on so the idea is simple drop servicing  

is to sell a service you don't need to know any 
skills anything just sell a service when someone  

buys it a freelancer will do it you give him a 
portion of the earnings and you get the rest super  

simple it's like drop shipping if you're familiar 
with and drop shipping you build an online store  

when someone buys a product you buy it from 
aliexpress you drop ship it from aliexpress  

and you sell it for the client or the customer 
you will earn the difference between prices  

i think the idea is simple drop servicing is the 
same but instead of selling physical products we  

are selling digital services let's give an example 
here is fiverr.com and i search for seo service  

you can see here we have a lot of people providing 
seo services let's say we found this one he  

provides 3500 do follow backlinks whatever for 26 
canadian dollars this is my currency here anyway  

what you are going to do is to publish a similar 
service on your website and you can sell it for 50  

so you can pay this guy here 26 and you can earn 
24 the idea is somehow simple or you can simply  

go to upwork find a freelancer here providing any 
service you want example seo again you can sell it  

and you will earn the price difference between 
the freelancer cost and the price that you set  

the idea is simple now the big question you 
will ask anyone will ask okay if we already  

have websites like upwork fiverr people per 
hour or freelancer.com all these websites  

why clients will come to your website instead 
of these big websites why why this will happen  

the first thing is that freelancing websites like 
upwork freelancer a lot of websites especially  

fiverr if you open and search for something 
here you will see a lot a lot of freelancers  

maybe maybe sometimes thousands of gigs here 
so you will simply get lost you need to check  

the reviews you need to test someone if you 
want a cheap service and so on while on your  

website you will have a dedicated website for 
a service it will give somehow more credibility  

for the clients that this website is specialized 
with this service instead of searching on fiverr  

for someone and testing and losing money 
and then testing another one and so on  

somehow from a psychological perspective it gives 
some more credibility for clients number two when  

you are working in drop servicing model you will 
do this job you have to search on fiverr on upwork  

for a professional freelancer with the best costs 
so you can deliver high quality services to your  

clients this will also give more credibility later 
on especially for you especially when you get some  

reviews and testimonials from your customers 
number two is simply on your website like here  

in my case you will do the promotion you will not 
just publish the website like this and sit down  

and wait for a customer you will never see 
one you are going to do our our promotion as  

you will see later in this video you are going 
to promote so people will find you through ads  

so it's like promoting any product online number 
three if you already have a website if you have an  

audience like in my case after i build it for five 
years now when i publish a service on my website  

my audience people who know about me who trust 
me they will prefer buying the service from me  

instead of searching for someone they don't know 
on other websites so think about it it works okay  

friends so now how to start this business what is 
the first step simply the first step is finding  

your niche the topic the service that you want

content research or ideas research to find the 
best service that fits you as i told you you

how to do it you will only drop services so what

marketing we have a lot of services here writing 
and translation video animation a lot of service  

we have here to provide so you can take a lot of 
ideas write them down and so on again on upwork

can check anyway do some research and narrow down  

your research with some topics that you can create 
a website about now how to select the best one  

what you are going to do here is to go to website

that help you grow and build your business  

go here to seo keyword research tool let's

example say search and then the application or  

this tool will give you the cpc the search volume 
per month and so on so you can understand how much  

difficult is to compete with this service so you

cpc bid we can see a lot of keywords ideas and 
topics related to this service that we can provide  

in the drop servicing website a new drop servicing

some topic research to find the best service 
to provide online and these metrics will help  

you a lot especially if you want to run paid ad 
campaigns as you will see in a little bit in this  

video so this is the first step content research 
of finding a topic or the niche of your service  

and by the way if you go to my website h2dk.com 
ebooks you will find this small ebook finding  

a profitable niche download this ebook it's 
totally free without anything just download  

and check it it's an awesome free ebook 
gives you a lot of ideas and topics that  

will help you in this content research step so 
you found your niche the second step is to build  

your website the drop servicing website of course 
in this guide you are not going to go step by step  

getting a hosting installing the website 
setting up things and so on no this is a guide  

for you to show you a step-by-step road map on 
how to build a successful drop servicing business  

so as you can see here i am using wordpress 
for my website for my main website hdk  

so what you are going to do is to install 
wordpress we did this a lot here on my channel  

my other free courses and so on and you can have 
a lot of videos here on youtube on the internet  

about creating wordpress websites it's super easy 
so i don't want to waste time now on this i want  

to focus on the main keys in this guide so this 
wordpress website what you are going to do is  

to install a plugin called woocommerce i think you 
know commerce if you are working online and simply  

you are going to add your products if you go 
into all products in my case you will see that  

i published all the services the products i am 
selling so let's open as an example this one edit  

just to show you how it works so this is the 
title then you add the service description  

in detail here then you go down and you select 
the product data as a simple product the price  

whatever you add whatever you want here and then 
you set an image and you publish it and it will  

look like this here on your website to sell it in 
your website the idea is simple a simple google  

search or youtube search will do the job and if 
you like me to create a full course in detail  

about this step by step technical wise i'm glad to 
do this just tell me in the comment section below  

but i don't think it's required as it's somehow 
simple to build such websites so you can see the  

service and they can pay here with paypal so here 
we are we published our services we are going now  

to move to the payment methods how you are going 
to get paid maybe you will tell me i don't have  

paypal i don't have stripe whatever what you are 
going to do here let's go back to woocommerce and  

if you go into settings we have a section for the 
payment methods you can see the payments section  

here we have a lot of methods like in my case i 
activated two methods the paypal checkout and the  

coinbase to get paid through cryptocurrency which 
is available almost world wide with a coinbase  

commerce solution you can see commerce.combase.com 
this is a website from coinbase one of the  

top crypto currency platforms worldwide 
will help you to get paid on your website  

with this plugin just install it and activate 
it you can also add woocommerce payments for  

the credit card so don't worry about the payment 
methods you can get paid with a lot of methods  

is available in your country that's enough for now 
i think the idea is now clear the main question  

now is how to promote and get our first customers 
let's see of course we have both free methods and  

paid methods obviously paid methods is faster you 
can get results from day one but simply it's paid  

and free methods is free but requires some more 
work let's start with the three methods number one  

if you go here to my youtube channel and go 
down here you will see i have this video how  

to increase website traffic you can see i have 
this video here how to get traffic full course  

i have like three or four videos full videos on 
how to get free traffic to your website you can  

watch these videos and learn how to get free 
traffic in short you can use pinterest you can  

use cora you can use facebook and social media 
you can create content on your blog on medium.com  

on blogger on codespaces you can create youtube 
videos creating content instagram profiles all  

these are free methods explained in detail in 
my courses as i told you it requires some really  

hard work maybe every day to build some audience 
to get traffic to get clicks to your website and  

get your first customers but it works the second 
free method is called mailing if you open here  

your gmail account your email and install a plugin 
called gmask you can see this extension the gmask  

extension you can simply use gmail with the gmask 
plugin explained before in my channel to turn your  

gmail account into an outreach email marketing 
system in this way you can send called emails  

to potential customers and promote your services 
number three a third free method is simply seo you  

can write content on your blog or simply optimize 
your website to get free organic traffic from  

google all this are explained here on my channel 
it's now out of scope to explain in detail  

now let's move on to the paid methods for paid 
methods i believe the best choice is google  

search ads as i told you before when you search 
for an idea a topic and you find a good idea  

with some search volume and good cpc you can 
simply go into google ads and create a paid ad  

campaign new campaign go here to website traffic 
then search traffic entry website click continue  

and then you add the keywords you want to target 
to promote your gig or your service again this  

requires a full course i'm preparing it it will 
be ready like maybe in two weeks a full google  

search ads to promote your products your services 
and everything else so you can create a campaign  

and promote your drop servicing website now the 
question is if you remember if you see here on  

my dashboard my earnings is two thousand dollars 
i told you the profit is one thousand where is  

this one thousand dollars let's see again 
here you can see two thousand dollars why  

i said one thousand dollars in the beginning of 
the video simply because it's a drop servicing  

so what i do i told the freelancers to follow up 
all the servers here on my website and they will  

get 50 commission so the total sales is two 
thousand dollars freelancers would earn one  

thousand dollars my net profit is one thousand 
dollars i hope you enjoyed this video this full  

guide to drop servicing i know we have a lot 
of details things you need to know understand  

more about marketing about the technical stuff 
and so on i will try my best to create a full  

detailed step-by-step course here on my channel 
if you want to support me help me do this just  

comment this below like the video subscribe to 
my channel and see you in the upcoming videos

24,Misleading,"if you are working online or you are thinking 
about working online from home obviously you will  

have this question how you will get paid how 
the money will come from the internet into my  

pocket how i will get the money physically to my 
credit cards into my bank accounts how this works  

in this short video in the next couple of minutes 
i want to answer exactly this question i will tell  

you how to get paid online by comparing two of 
the top companies worldwide that allows you to get  

paid which is paypal and payoneer.com i will share 
with you around seven or eight factors that will  

help you choose between those two companies or 
maybe use both in your online business as i do i  

will share with you the factors examples from my 
business everything so stay tuned and follow up

hi everyone i'm hassan from h-educate 
and today i'm so glad to publish this  

new small video to help you understand how you 
will get paid when you work online from home  

so let's don't waste time and go directly and see 
how things work an example from my dashboard here  

i am logged into my CJ account CJ is an affiliate 
network so if you are working affiliate marketing  

you probably heard about CJ so anyway forget 
about the company now it's just an example so  

you can see like maybe this month i made around 
1600 from affiliate marketing on this website how  

i will transfer this money into my bank account 
or my credit card or maybe get them physically  

in my hands if you go here to my account and go to 
my account settings here admin settings you will  

see here the payment information and you can see i 
connected a bank account directly to this company  

so the first method to get paid online is 
simply connecting your bank account to the  

company directly and the company will send you the 
money directly into your bank account so this is  

the first method the second method which is more 
popular is using what i call a broker service  

this service will manage and secure the payments 
between you and all the companies online so as an  

example if i go here we have paypal.com i think 
you heard about it and we have payoneer.com these  

two companies these two services will help you 
get paid online so let's give the first example  

and see different factors and differences between 
these two companies let's say you have a website  

i will go here and open my academy just to show 
you a direct example this will help you understand  

things better so this is my academy here okay 
if you want to buy a course now from academy  

you have to pay me inside the website so if you 
have an academy online courses if you if you sell  

digital services physical products whatever you 
sell on your website you need a method to get  

paid inside your website okay please focus very 
well because there's a big difference here between  

getting paid online in general and getting paid 
directly from clients in your website so as an  

example if i open like this course and i want to 
buy it from my academy if i click enroll now you  

will see here is the complete your purchase page 
and you can pay with paypal you can see paypal  

so the first company which is paypal allows you 
to get paid directly inside your website okay so  

just memorize this if you want to get paid 
inside your website and you want to choose  

between paypal and payoneer you have to select 
paypal because simply payoneer doesn't have an  

option to collect payments and get paid within 
your website okay so this is the first difference  

which is collecting payments inside your own 
website let's go now to the second example  

if i go here to udemy.com i think you know udemy 
it's a courses marketplace or you can buy and  

sell courses i will go into my instructor account 
since i teach on udemy also anyway i will go to  

my profile and click on pay-out settings so udemy 
is a company if you see here in udemy can activate  

both paypal or payoneer so inside udemy you 
can get paid from paypal or from payoneer if  

we go here back to our companies you can select 
both paypal or payoneer if you want to get paid  

from companies so payoneer allows you mainly to 
get paid and get money from companies you are  

working with like udemy or any other service 
that has the payoneer option inside it okay  

so this is the second option that both services 
have which is accepting payments from companies  

let's go to the third example here is my google 
adsense dashboard google adsense simply is a  

service from google allows you to monetize your 
website with ads and make money online by the way  

if you want to learn about google adsense or maybe 
CJ affiliate marketing i have full free courses  

here on my channel please check the description 
below you'll find links to my full free courses  

explaining step by step for beginners how to make 
money online with affiliate marketing with CJ  

with google adsense and much much more anyway 
so here is my adsense account if i click on  

payments you will see here i can manage my 
payment methods let's open this and you will  

see that google adsense allows you to connect a 
bank account let's edit this back and count here  

you will see it's a checking back account which 
ends with one two five three why i'm showing you  

this let's see together if i go back here to my 
payoneer account if i go here to receive section  

and click on global payment service you will 
see here that i created this bank account inside  

payoneer you can see this is the account 
one two five three it's in usa in the u.s  

so this is one of the best features about payoneer 
it allows you to create virtual bank accounts  

outside your country as an example you live in 
europe you live in india and middle east anywhere  

you can create a us bank account to accept 
payments in different countries so you can  

see this the bank account here in the usa if 
you go here to my activity again you will see  

the transactions you will see as an example i 
got paid from google last month to this account  

nine thousand dollars you can see from google 
adsense so you can create a virtual bank account  

inside pioneer this option isn't available in 
paypal in paypal you can connect only your bank  

account directly and you can't create new virtual 
bank accounts so if you live in a country where  

you want to create a virtual bank account in the 
u.s or maybe let's see where we have also options  

we have also options in japan in australia and 
singapore you can also in the uk so you can create  

virtual back accounts in different countries 
and connect your payoneer account so this is my  

account connected here let's go back again 
to google adsense and if you go back to my CJ  

i connected also this to my CJ account so i accept 
payments from both CJ and google adsense directly  

into my payoneer virtual bank account so this 
is very important please focus very well this  

is very important option which is found in 
payoneer you can see the first century bank  

and this is the bank account number now you may 
tell me okay i created it how i transfer money  

from payoneer into my physical bank account in my 
country simply you can... you go here to withdraw  

section and you will see here your withdrawal page 
and you can withdraw money easily from payoneer  

into your bank account in your country so simple 
also what's nice about payoneer and paypal also  

this option is available in both is you can 
create mastercard to use anywhere worldwide  

you can simply withdraw money from any atm 
machine worldwide you can see this is my  

payoneer mastercard it's an expired card by the 
way you can get the card number if you want and  

the cvv is eight five five you can use it and 
hack it if you want so this is one also of the  

options very important options which is creating 
or getting mastercards physical mastercards  

on both payoneer and paypal now another factor or 
another thing you have to consider when choosing  

between payoneer or paypal is availability to 
make things simple payoneer is available almost  

worldwide in all the countries almost like this 
while paypal is available in a list of countries  

so if paypal is not available in your country 
you don't have any choice except going with  

payoneer okay the last thing about policies i have 
to mention this because it's also very important  

payoneer has somehow more strict policies 
as an example you can't transfer money  

for giveaways as an example if you're following 
me you know i run always giveaways and by the way  

i announced the winners of the last giveaway so 
please go to h-educate.com/giveaway and check if  

you want you can see here i say $50 cash paypal 
why because paypal allows you to transfer gifts  

to your friends like giveaways or whatever but in 
payoneer you can't do this it's a policy violation  

so also be careful about this in payoneer so this 
is it about getting paid online to sum up mainly  

we have two options connect your your bank account 
directly into a service that allows this option or  

the most popular one is using paypal or payoneer 
and explain the most important difference between  

them so this will help you choose what fits your 
business or maybe join them together as i do in my  

online business please don't forget if you like to

 Digital marketing. online business and make money online

 And turn on the notifications to get every new update

 i publish on my channel so let's start directly and stop wasting time and

The first method to make money online with this mobile device is simply

 Instagram, instagram Okay before I tell you in detail what we can do

 I want to mention that  instagram is one of the best

 The best and the powerful places not only to start a business but to market

 any business also now let's stick to the point, and let's see how

 to make money using instagram,

 In instagram mainly we have three methods to make money  

 online to build an online business with only instagram

 Number one is what we call selling shoutouts if I now go to my YouTube channel

 Here you will see this video. Earn 33 dollars

 per post on instagram, here in this video I explained in detail

 How to set up and grow an instagram account I shared with you

 some free tools and techniques and tips and tricks to grow the Instagram account

 to reach at least a couple of thousands of followers and how to sell a shout-out

 In detail, so please go and check this video to learn in detail how  to sell 

 shout-outs now one thing I i missed in the video

 Or I didn't think it was that important and I got a lot of questions

 about is after we grow the Instagram account like in my case this is my Instagram account

 If you go here, I have like 2000 followers today

 On my account with around 7% engagement rate so my shout-out

 can cost around $ 50 per post but how to sell it, where to sell it?

 So simply after you grow the instagram account after you watch this video here

 You can go to the website called shoutcart.com and list your account

 You see here you can filter by categories and you will see each account and you can

 Buy a shout-out here, so you can list yourself as an influencer

 As an account owner in this website, also  we have shoutoutexperts.com

 Another website is Influencer-cart.com, all these websites are places are Marketplaces

 To sell your shout-outs, so the idea is that simple

 You have to create  an instagram account get a couple of thousand followers

 The most important thing is to get high engagement on your account I explain this

in detail in this video, please go and watch it and then you can sell on these websites

 also you can sell on Fiverr. If you go to Fiverr.com, now you can sell this as a gig

 Look at this person

 I will give you a shout-out on my 800k Instagram page

 This has another one here, this is on a Facebook group, okay here

 I will shout-out on my 238k Instagram gaming

page and so on. Also we have a website called shoutify.io and

 you can sign up as an influencer and sell your shout-outs

 so the idea is somehow simple you just need to work like 20 or 30 minutes a day only with your mobile phone

 Totally free on instagram

 Please go and watch this video to learn in detail

 how this works so this is selling shout-outs on Instagram, method 2

 In instagram is to sell products, you can sell your products of your own

 or sell affiliate products. As I told you Instagram is a great place

to market anything you want simply because it has

 56% more engagement rate than Facebook, so any post I publish today

 On my instagram account, it gets at least 600 reach from my

 Two thousand so it's really great, any post I will show you this like this

 one, this is my video it reached 665 person in the last 24 hours

 Out of two thousand, so imagine if you have like 10k followers on insatagram

 You can get with one click 1000 impressions

 It's an awesome free place to market anything so you can sell both

 Your products or an affiliate products. Let's see an example if you go here back to

 Instagram this is an account called healthish it has around 84k

 Followers and you can see Click below to shop This is the link

 To their shop so think about it, they have a lot of followers they are linked to

 Their shop directly even in their stories, you can see in their stories here if you click on shop

 You will see stories with links if you click see more here, you will open also the store

 To buy this bottle or whatever so instagram is also a great place to sell

 products online without doing anything just from your mobile phone

This also can be an affiliate product by the way

 So you can pick a product from clickbank

or whatever and promote it on your Instagram profile

 The third method to make money with Instagram is flipping accounts

 If you go to a website called fameswap,  here you can sell and buy instagram accounts

and this methoud somehow is really great especially for beginners so what you can do is open

 A new instagram account maybe grow it into 1000 followers with some engagement

 and go here and sell it on fameswap, or on socialtradia or instasale

 All of these websites are places where you can sell

and buy instagram accounts. So this for instagram

 You can flip accounts sell and buy. You can sell products or affiliate products

 and you can sell shout-outs, I hope the idea is somehow simple

 Let's move on to the next method, to the next way on how to make money

 How to build a Business with Your Mobile Phone, number 2 is Blogging

 Just writing and monetizing your blog, you can do it with your mobile only

 I explain this in detail in this video, you can see here earn $ 20

 per day from google, i explain step by step

 How to Reach $ 20 per day writing and monetizing your blog

Please go and watch this video, and also go down here and you'll find this video here

5 ways to monetize your website. With your mobile only you can start a Wordpress website

a blogger website totally for free with free hosting. You can check also

 this video here, how to get free hosting if you are

 a beginner and start blogging writing about something you love whatever you want

 And monetize your blog with ads, please go watch these videos

 I explained step-by-step how to do this, Method number three is to providing support

 with your mobile how is this, what I mean here is to provide

like consultation over mobile, or maybe provide support maybe technical support

maybe tutoring like teaching english

 We have a lot of websites as an example we have websites like skooli.com

 we have studypool you can see earn money for answering homework questions you can see this

 onlineenglishteaching.com, vipkid.com

 All these websites will help you teach English as an

 example online with your mobile phone you can open a session

 And go in a conversation with someone who is trying to learn English so you can improve

 His English with conversation. This is one of the best ways now to be honest with you

 I don't do this, I provide consultation and IT support

 You know if you are following me I have an IT background I used to be

an IT support guy in a company like 6 years ago

 Or 5 years ago, so what I do today, till today I open a 

 Video-call with someone who wants an IT support a video-call on whatsapp

 as an example and tell him the solution, so it's somehow a remote support by mobile only

 I do this twice a month i think, or maybe three times a month, providing IT support

 For one company till today he's my friend that's why I do it for him

also i provide consultation so you can do a Zoom call or maybe record a podcast

 Or whatever for someone and sell it. In this way

 It's somehow a consultation online with your mobile. So this is method number 3

i'm trying my best to be somehow fast to tell you the ideas

the links the websites, all of them will be in the description below just to have the idea

 You can go and search about it and start your own business whatever you are doing you have your mobile

 You have the ideas, go and work. That simple. Method number 4 is working as  a freelancer

  I mentioned that you can work on instagram with your mobile 

 You can blog on your mobile 

 You can consult with your mobile all these tasks can be 

freelancing tasks you can go to Fiverr as an example, open Fiverr here 

 And here on Fiverr, you can sell a gig that you can manage an Instagram account 

 Or manage social media accounts

and by the way, today we have a lot of apps on the mobile

 It allows you to manage social media 
accounts so easy, I use in my case

an app called contant studio, I am not an affiliate or sponsoring it, I just use it. It's somehow

 simple and good you can use a hoodsuit or whatever you want

 You can manage social media accounts from your mobile 

 You can also provide blogging, you can provide a writing service

 On Fiverr from your mobile also, you can provide

 A consultation gig as we mentioned before on Fiverr so also we have a lot of 

 Ideas, freelancing gigs that you can also do only with your mobile

phone just use your brain, think a little bit

 And you will work only with your mobile. Method number 5 the last one for today

 It is what we call application testing, so a lot of people

 are developing apps for mobiles and they want someone to test them before

 They can publish to ensure it has no bugs

 And it works perfectly on different phones

 Etc. So we have websites like usertesting.com

 where you can make money online around $10 for every 20 minutes of app testing

 Go to usertesting.com now just to be honest with you

 This website doesn't accept anyone whatsoever as such

 You need some qualifications, like knowing how to test apps, maybe you can

 Learn how to do this, go to udemy as an example

 udemy.com and search for a course on

 How to test apps, let's say test apps, whatever

 You can take a course on udemy on how to test a mobile app

 Tesing or whatever and then you can go to usertesting

 You have the qualifications that you can start making money online, get paid

 With usertesting on your mobile phone, only testing applications

 So here are five ways you can work from home

 Using a mobile phone from zero dollars

 Starting today, the only thing you need is just to get started, to just take action

 As always, I say 90% of people will not take action that is why they fail

 This is why they don't do it

 This is why they don't make money online or 

 They test for five minutes or maybe ten days or five days and after that

 They simply fail and stop if you want to change your life

 You have to think differently, change your mindset and you will succeed

 See you later

 In this video, you don't have any excuse to start working with your mobile.

 I'm Hassan from H-educate and it's very cold here

 So let's start directly in our topic, and don't waste more time but please don't forget if

 so let's start our work directly, now you know me, honestly

 is one of the main rules here on my channel, to make money

on Instagram, it's not that that that simple

 as I explained in the introduction, just by posting. You need to do some work,

 but I believe this method that I will show you

in this video is one of the easiest methods anyone can do 

 you need only your mobile phone, only with Instagram so, please

 how to start and I will share with you

 some free tools I developed for you to grow on Instagram.

 So please don't miss any minute, this video may really change your phone

 change your Instagram account into a money-making machine

 Let's start, so I think like everyone here has an Instagram account

 If you don't have one, you can just go to Instagram.com

 and create one, It's free and so simple. So, here is my Instagram account

 opened on my desktop, on my browser and you can see I have like 1,200 followers

 So the idea here about this video

 is to create an Instagram account to get some followers like 1000 followers

 to have a good engagement with your posts in your account

 and then you can simply sponsor other people, like posting

 a sponsored posts, a sponsored images on your profile.

 So, in that case, you just post an image, and you

make money, you post a video and you earn money, that simple.

 The first step here in this strategy is to build a 

good Instagram profile and this is what I'm going to share with you now

in detail. How to build an Instagram profile. How to create

 posts very easily and for free and then how to sponsor 

 others and how to know how much your Instagram profile value

 So you can charge people on. So, I'll explain everything, this video

 is really very interesting. So, this is my profile and any of 

 Those posts i publish on my profile gets at least 

 Around 40% or 30% engagement, so at least 300 or 400 people

 Out of 1,200. So, 

 I think it's a very good engagement rate. So, how to create such post

 that gives you a high engagement rate. Let's see together, let's say

 I want to create like this one, like this post

 It's a small quote with a background image. now you may tell me I don't know

 any quotes, I don't want to search and find and whatever

 I don't know how to get free images, don't worry

 I'll show you how to create these posts  now in one minute

 What you are going to do simply is to go to Canva.com

 Now it's totally free, you don't need any pre membership 

 everything explained is free. Go here to create a design and click

 on Instagram post, it will give you the optimal Instagram size or the best size

 for Instagram post, what we are going to do here simply

 is go to photos and choose a free photo. You can see

 this is my free photo here, I will put it right-click and click set image

as background, and by the way Canva has a

 mobile application, you can do all this on mobile. So, just add this background

 so simple in one click. Now you may tell me from where

 I can get those quotes. By the way the quotes you see here

 I write them, but you don't need to think

 and search a lot, I'll give you now a free website

 to get hundreds maybe thousands of free quotes to create

 on your profile. So, let's open a new tab and open a website called Brainyquote.com

 That's it. By the way, all links are in the description below

 So don't worry about the link, it's brainyquote.com

 here you'll find a lot of quotes. Let's say you want to add motivational quotes

 Open this and now you can see,  we have a lot of

 motivational quotes here, we can just copy and paste. Let's say

 I want to get this one, just open it, and by the way, you can also

 create it here on brainyquote, it give you a free image also

 But we'll use Canva because I think it's more professional

 So just copy this, like this, copy, go here to Canva and ctrl + v

 to paste it like this. let's change the font we make it

 For example 71, put it here and let's change the

font set it to this one for example or this one

 very nice, that's it. You finished an image

 You can resize it like this, if you go  here, see this

 Love icon or Like icon. Go to elements, I will say love, anything

 you get here, put it here, resizes it like this

 and here we are, we have the post, we have the image

 to post on our profile, simply click on download the image

 download and then post on your profile. what you are going to do is 

 to post at least three, four, or five times per day

on your profile, something that people love to get

 some engagement on your profile to get a high engagement rate

 so later on when you wanna post a sponsored photo,

 the price will be higher and you can earn more money

 if you have higher engagement on your profile

 so now you have your Instagram account, you learned how to create

 Instagram posts very easily using Canva and brainyquotes and by the way

 If you have some ideas you can use it, you, you can use whatever you want

 just be sure to post every day like three, four or five 

 To get a high engagement on your Instagram profile.

 So, now we have the profile, we have the post and you started posting

 Now the main question is how to grow your Instagram

 How to get at least one thousand followers so you can get like ten

 dollars or twenty dollars per post on your profile.

 Simply, go to my YouTube channel and then go to videos

 and here you will find this video.

 ""How I Got 920 Instagram Followers in 13 Days Only""

 If you want you can watch this video

 to take some ideas. But in general two main rules to grow your Instagram profile.

Two main rules, keep in mind. Number one

 is to post on a daily basis, be consistent 

post on a daily basis, and add

 the appropriate tags, add appropriate hashtags. Now, when you post on Instagram

 let's say I want to post something, I will add a photo, anything now

 just to show you this, let's say I'm posting

 go to downloads, this post, you see next here, you can add here hashtags

 you can see like for example, ""quote"" whatever

 nd when you are writing on Instagram, it will give you some

 relevant hashtags and suggestions and it will give you 

 how much posts we have in each hashtag so you can see here we have

 for this hashtag 117 million post, so it is very hard to rank on this tag

 you have to get somehow low competition tags

so to help you, I created a free tool that gives you a big list

of hashtags with the post number so you can choose

 the best for your account as a beginner starting

 to rank on easy hashtags

 so, in the description below, you will find a link, download my free tool, I will open it now

 To show you how it works. Please focus well

 It is very important to follow up with me after you download the tool

 you will have these files, just open, you don't need to

 Install anything, just open the application,  you will find this

 simple application, what you are going to do simply is

 Let's say you want to post about quotes, so say ""quotes"" and click

 on find and you can see in like two seconds it will give you

 A big list of hashtags. Simply filter by post or sort by post

 and go down and search for hashtags with a low number of posts

 You can see here like 200,000 posts we have here 1 billion or 11

 billions, I don't know how much. It's a big number, so use this free application

 to get a list of hashtags. Let's say you want to search

 for ""dogs"" as an example, anything click on find

 and again it will give you a full list of hashtags

 about dogs, sort, and get the low number of post hashtags to use in

 your posts, search for whatever you want. In my case

 maybe I search for digital marketing, email marketing, online business

 It depends on your niche, but if you have a general profile

 about quotes or whatever you can search for quotes

 search for whatever you want, but as a small advice also go

 and be specific, select a niche, select a target topic, so when

 you want to sponsor someone, you will have a targeted niche

 where will people will love to sponsor their photos and videos on your profile

 So, get a list of tags using my free simple hashtag tool

 Now here's a small, important point you have to know

 this tool sometimes does not work directly using this button

 This ""find"" button, it gives you an error as an example

 If you click on ""find"" sometimes it gives you this error

 ""Something went wrong"" don't worry just go here

to extract from json and enter the keyword here again like as an example

 Dogs, dogs and copy this full URL Step 2 Copy it Open your web browser

 just paste the URL here, so simple

 and then copy this response all data her copy ctrl + c 

 and then paste in the output section here

 and click read hashtags, the same operation it will read everything

 sometimes it have somehow has an authentication problem with Instagram

 So you can fix this using this manual method, anyway, it is

 too simple to use and will give you

a full list of hashtags. You can also export to CSV

 and keep on your PC, you can build

 a library of hashtags using this application so you can use whenever you want

 So just go download the application 

 from the description below and use it to create a list of hashtags to use

 In your profile, so this is how you can start on Instagram. Create a profile

 create posts using Canva totally for free, using brainyquote

 to get some quotes if you don't have any ideas

 it will give you directly some quotes to post on your profile

 Watch my video about growing on Instagram

  you can go and watch more videos about

 growing on Instagram I'm really honest with you I'm not

  that expert in Instagram, but I am sharing with you my knowledge

 You can watch other videos, you can maybe watch courses, whatever you want

 Just grow your Instagram profile to reach at least like 1000 followers

 in a specific niche and get somehow a high engagement rate

 Now after you do this maybe it will take you like

 two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, It depends on your work

 and by the way, it doesn't take more than thirty minutes a day so, please

 just try it, just try to do this. after that you'll go to a website called

 socialbluebook.com and see your values so after you sign up 

 and connect your platform as an example here my Facebook page

a dedicated post costs only twenty dollars, it depends on your profile

here is my youtube channel, you can see

 I can post a video and earn up to $ 1,300

 per video, this is because my channel has 

 somehow a big audience and high engagement rate

 This is my Instagram profile. I have 1200 followers

 I have 7.6% engagement percentage, I have like 92 likes per post

 approximately. So, my suggested price per post is $ 33, per video

 Per image is $ 18, so you can see  it is somehow simple to start

 with this business online using only your Instagram profile

 with mobile, so I think the idea now is clear

 I explained almost everything you need to know, now last question you may ask.

 is how I can find sponsors, how I can find people

 who want to post on my profile, before I tell you

 this, just one important point. Don't transfer

 your Instagram profile into an ad directory or a profile just

filled with ads, no, don't post every day a story for someone else or a photo for someone else

 No, keep things normal, let people love

 your content, you can do this maybe once a week, maybe twice a week

 maybe three times per week but not every day or every day

 a couple of posts, just make things real and keep people engaged

 with your profile, later on when you grow more and more

and you have more followers,  you can earn a lot more than this

 with only one post as you can see on my channel

 with only one video I can make 1000 dollars

 Now how we can find someone that may be interested in posting on our profile

 How we can connect with other people. Let's see together

 Number one is something you can do, you can contact people and ask them if they 

 want to sponsor something on your profile, how using two main methods

 using cold emailing, you can contact the mail

 targeted people as I explained in my other videos

 Or, you can simply contact them on Instagram

 So simply you can search for people in your niche

 and ask them if they are interested in posting on your profile

and promoting something in your profile, method number two

 which is somehow automated, when your profile is visible 

 on Instagram, we have services like socialbakers.com

 Where people can find influencers, so people will find you automatically

 So please don't worry a lot now from day one

 how you will get your first ad How you will promote someone

 Just focus now on promoting and growing your Instagram profile

 and getting a high engagement rate, getting a high number of followers

 Then later on you will see how people will contact you automatically 

 to promote something on your profile, I'm telling you this

 from my experience, believe me, every day on my email

 on my private messaging, I get people asking me to promote something

 So please don't worry about this step from now, just go and start with step one

 create posts, post every day, build your profile

 on Instagram and you'll see how you'll be successful later on

studies and real experience, I'm
the founder of Educate Eats, a Beatles,

English sticks and multiple
other services, so I think you'll enjoy

my content. So go now hip hop star
mother and daughter invitations to get every new

update without wasting time. Let's
stop and see what is YouTube s e o simply

in one minute. As c o stands for search
engine optimization and YouTube

is a search engine, so you do as
SEO simply is how to optimize your videos

to rank on top of YouTube. So let's
go here and open a private YouTube session.

I was searching for email marketing as
an example for beginners. This keyword enter,

you will see my video is on top
of YouTube, so I can get a lot of views

from search results. Organic views if you go
here and search for Google AdSense.

This simple keyword you will see my video
is on top of YouTube, the second video

here. Not only that, if you go here to my view
with ranking report, you will see

I am ranking on top of YouTube for all
these keywords here. More than 50 keywords

ranking on top of YouTube. So how
I am doing this, this is what I'm going

to share with you in this video. The idea
is simple we have three main steps number

one keyword research, then
video optimization and number three.

Boosting your video and tracking your
ranking. So I think the best way to learn

this is with a practical live
example. So I will pick a video and let's start

practically and see me now live how
I optimize my videos, so I will pick this

video. Google AdSense tutorial I'm
ranking on top of YouTube as I showed you that

little bit. So step number one is to do
keyword research. How I do this simply,

I use to services eight super tools
and morning fame. Simply go to eight super

tools dot com my free as SEO and digital
marketing tools platform. Go hit

the YouTube section YouTube Q2 and here
I will go and enter Google AdSense,

which is my video topping enter to search.
And now this awesome free tool will give

you more than 300 keyword ideas to use
in your video. So we have a lot of key with

ideas and topics you can get from this
awesome free to now. In my case, I found

that Google AdSense has around 300000
searches per month, which is really a big

number because the is somehow medium.
Now here you have to understand something very

important in terms of difficulty. In my case,
since my channel is somehow big,

I can go with medium and high
difficulty keyword. But if your channel is still

small, I prefer you pick a low.
Difficult to argue its logo here as an example,

and you can see this keyword is low.
Google AdSense for press this keyword,

we can find low difficulty
keywords and create videos about these topics

so you can rank and break the search
algorithm and rank on YouTube.

If you are a small channel, go with
low difficulty and if your channel is big

and go with medium to high difficulty,
now I will give you a better tip to choose

your key. Now here we found some keywords
I will go to is the second tool,

which is morning theme. Go to topic
here and then I will say Google AdSense again.

First, I would pick the schema go to step
number three. This tool, by the way,

is really awesome. I will go down here
and you will see now it will show me something

called a gateway VIDEO. This is the video
that you need to target and to break

through. Now, in my case, this town
has around one hundred thirty one thousand

subscribers. I have bigger numbers,
are somehow easier for me to break through

this video. But depending on your
channel size your audience, you need to target

this gateway video to break through
this how you picked the correct keywords. So do

some keyword research. He'll select
the key with a morning theme and pick up your

Gateway video to break through. Now,
step number two is to create your video.

If you don't have the video you get
on your channel. You need to create

it recorded and then upload to YouTube.
Now, if you didn't record your video yet,

which is better, by the way, when you plan
for SEO, you plan before you start

creating the video. So in the video,
you have to focus on two tips. Number one

is to mention the target keyword while
you are talking, you know, 2021. The voice

recognition today is very important,
so always tried to mention the key words

a lot of studies show that
mentioning. A Kingwood helps you to understand what

the video is about. The number two is to create
an awesome intro to who the viewers

to continue watching so you can
increase the view duration is very important

to give YouTube a sign that this
video is performing well on the platform.

But if you have recorded a video like
in my case, you just need to optimize it.

How we optimize it, optimize mainly
three things the title, the description

and the thumbnail. This combination,
thumbnail title and description is super

important. This is the most
important thing on YouTube. Now you may ask me,

and what about the tags? If you go
down here, the dogs, you can see that

I am ranking on top of YouTube. Almost
all of these tags tags is somehow important,

but you can see now YouTube. They've
the tags play a minimal role in helping

viewers find your video, and it's
only useful when you videos commonly

misspelled. I'll tell you now. Tags
are not important at all. We will add tags

and you will see how easy is to add
tags now in one click. Well, tagged is not

the main factor today. The main factors
or title thumbnail and the main description,

though this is what you need to optimize
very well. How to do this Let's go back

to morning theme and click on step
number four. You will see here we have the title.

We have a description you can add we have
the tags automatically generated for you.

Just copy the tags and paste and your
video tags you now. What about the title?

To make things easier for you, the best
format for the title is to mention

the target keyword at the beginning.
Then, something catchy after the keyword like

in my case, my target key within SEO
is Google AdSense, then 15 steps to make

sixty eight point eight dollars per
day. And by the way, it's not a click bait.

I make this and more per day and this
Google AdSense video I showed you how

exactly I do this. If you're
interested, you can check the video money

on the screen. So mentioned the keyword
and then something catchy. And by the way,

morning fame will give you some hints
as an example to tell you here. Write a shot

of the title as an example. If I remove
this, maybe it would be better.

You Typekit as well optimized. So this
is how we can create the title. And then

you would go to the description here
into the description. You have to mention your

target keyword for sure in the first
paragraph. And what's nice? No more.

Nothing. You can highlight that up
this and you will see no bags for videos

or highlight description. I think the best
way today to mention tags within your

videos, and I think this is happening
also on Instagram and this is what social media

is doing today. Anyway, they'll try
to mention the hashtags also and the target

keyword and your description.
This is number two, and it will show

you a percentage of the optimized
description that you have written for your

video, though also, it will help
you to write with description and show

you if you need to optimize or not.
Also, what's nice about morning fame? You can

click here on show hashtags and to give
you a list of related hashtags to add your

videos. An example here. AdSense Make
money online and passive income for this

video as hashtags. So when you open
this video on YouTube, you will see that this

video is under these hashtags that you can
see under these hashtags. So this is how

we optimize the title and the description.
We still have the thumb nail. If you go

down here, you will see a place where you can
upload a YouTube thumbnail and what's

nice? This is my all time. And by the way,
I change it to this one today.

So if you click on show sizes, it will
show you different sizes of mobile

and tablet on desktop and so on. So to give
you an idea how your video will

appear on YouTube before you publish
so you can think about your thumbnail,

maybe and change it and go on now for thumbnails.
It's out of scope now on how

to create the best thumbnail. I will
do a full video about this soon. I think so.

If you're interested, don't forget
to download applications to get everything

you update. And by the way, morning
fame. This tool is invite only tool. You can see

it's invitation only. So if I enjoy
it for free, you can use my invite code

in the description below, or you can
simply find it anywhere on the internet

and use it to join morning theme. Now,
step number three is to try and boost your

video. Let's start with tracking
something to track your rankings to see

if you are ranking on top of YouTube
or not. How you do this. The simplest method

is to go here to your Chrome browser
or whatever browser and open a new incognito

window, a private tab. Go to YouTube
here and search for your keyword, say Google

AdSense. And then you will see if your
video is on top of YouTube or not, you can

use also be asked if you want to buy
a VPN connection. Try different countries

and so on. This is the basic method,
but if you have a lot of videos, you can drag

them out of keywords. You need to use
a tool for this. And in my case, I use

to body, which is one of the best
tools for YouTubers. If you are almost the next

level, you must be using to buddy. You can
see here in the search rank tracking,

you can add keywords to track. In my case,
I add around 50 keywords I'm tracking

right now. Now, the keyword tracking
option inside to the body, unfortunately,

is not free. You need to get a license,
at least stall license or legend to use

the keyword tracking feature. But the good
news is soon I will develop a free tool

inside a super tools. I will add to the YouTube
section here the YouTube keyword

ranking, too. They can track your
ranking on YouTube for free if you want to get all

the updates. All my free
tools, everything. Don't forget to smash

the Subscribe button. Log the video
and audio vacations to not miss any new

update. Now we still have the boosting
box. Boosting Simply Means is promoting

your YouTube video outside YouTube.
Give it some signals from outside YouTube,

so you can note that this video is getting
traffic from outside the platform.

It's like an SC. Oh, we have
backlinks in Google or social signals. Think

about it like this. So what you can do
is you can show your video on all your social

profiles. I do. I use a tool called
Content Studio where we can share and one

click you post everywhere. It's an awesome
tool, by the way. I just select my pages,

my groups, my Twitter, LinkedIn,
Tumblr, even Instagram, and simply paste your link

here and post on all your profiles in one
click. Also, I use push notifications.

If you have a website, go now and start
collecting push notification subscribers

because an educated is super
those. I have around 46000 subscribers.

Whenever I publish a video, I simply
don't campaign and push the video to all these

subscribers in the first hour. Then I send
an email. You can see this convert get

my private email list I share with
my subscribers every new update and so on.

So email marketing is also one of the best
ways to promote your video. And this

is why I tell you always go and start
a website. Whatever you are doing online,

start a website to build your
audience. Collect emails, push notifications.

No phone is Reddit. Reddit is one of the best
places to get traffic. The simple

formula and Reddit give value. Build
your karma and get the traffic you need to give

value and Reddit. You need to engage
regularly to give value to people. Then

it can get traffic from this
awesome website that gets around 1.6

billion monthly visits. Then go to website
called Find a Forum Dot Net and find

a forum in your niche. Go into categories
and go to something related to your niche

and start engaging in these forums to get
traffic to your videos. And by the way,

on my website and age indicate we have
a forum. We have more than 35000 members,

60000 posts. You can go here,
engage and share your videos without spamming

and the last source of traffic. The YouTube
channel, which is one of my best

sources, is called on. We can see
here in my stats. If you go up and hear

my account, you will see I have
around 500000 content views on my posts here

on Corda and my answers and questions.
Kota is a treasure. I always repeat this.

A lot of people just maybe don't
have the patience to wait and engage and get

traffic from this treasure. Believe
me, it's a treasure. Go now and engage

in code. And if you'd like to learn
my top eight secrets on how to get traffic

from Cobra, you can watch this video. See
you later!

So how i did this? How i'm getting

this

short period ? Simply the Traffic

[Music]

get traffic into your blogs, into your

websites in a very short time.

You will need to work only 10 or 15

minutes a day

for only 10 days consistently and you

will see

results. I know a lot of you will not

even continue the video,

will not even watch these couple of

minutes, some of you will not

even try this. It's only 15 minutes and

they will not try it.

Then after one month they will send me a

message

or start asking here and there how i get

traffic to my website. Friend, i am

telling you how to get traffic.

Please watch these couple of minutes and

apply it,

only 15 minutes a day. Instead of

scrolling

into facebook and wasting your time just

apply this method which is really super

simple

and free. Just try it and you will see

it's working. It worked with me, it works

with millions of people

all over the world. What is this method?

how it works?

let's see together. But please before we

start don't forget

if you like to watch more videos like

this about

online business, make money online,

digital marketing, and much

much more please go now smash the red

button ""subscribe now""

and like the video, turn notifications to

get

every new update almost every

day. So let's start. So

what is the Traffic Bomber Method?

By the way i call it like this, there is

nothing called Bomber Method.

So what is this method? what we are going

to do simply

is copying and pasting your content

on different websites all over the

internet.

On websites that are getting millions of

visitors

every month. Super simple! just copy

and paste your own content your own blog

post

on other websites. I will show you now

the websites one by one,

step by step, and explain how this method

will really

help you get a lot of traffic. Thousands

of

new users, people into your website.

So let's start with website number one.

Number one is Linkedin .Linkedin,

of course, I'm not here to tell you go

and paste your links inside

the feed. No! In linkedin if you have an

account,

perfect! if you don't have one, go and

sign up. Linkedin, today,

is one of the best social media

or social networks that will help you

grow and get traffic. Simply inside your

account go and click on 'write

article' and not a post and simply copy

and paste the article

into your linkedin profile. As an example

i have this article here, i will open it

simply copy the title 'ctrl c'. Go here,

paste the headline and simply go back

and start copying your article and

pasting in linkedin.

It will take less than one minute to

publish your article on linkedin.

Maybe you tell me now, what i will get

from this?

Please follow up! I will show exactly how

this will help you

post the same articles on linkedin as

articles okay. The next website, the

second website

is Quora. Quora is simply a QnA website,

that you can ask and answer questions on.

But today i'm not here to tell you go

and answer questions and link back.

No! In quora you will go to your profile

here, click on your profile,

and then you can create a space on quora.

You can see,

I have this space ""make money online here!""

I will open it and I am a contributor in

different spaces

in quora. Now what you are going to do

is create an account on quora. Sign up

and here click on ""create a space"". Name it

whatever you want. I'll write a

description

and then in the space ,here is my space,

you can add an image whatever you want.

It's like a small website, a small group,

a small

space for you inside quora. You can post

your own articles

and again simply open this and start

copying and pasting your articles

on quora. Again! please! some patience i

will tell you in a little bit how this

will really

help you a lot. So just copy and paste as

you can see here i pasted my articles,

here, and I have now 705 followers.

And by the way if you like to join us

you can go to quora you will find the

link in description below to join this

space, it's totally free and get all the

updates and so on.

So paste the same articles inside your

Quora space.

The third website is medium.com.

Medium allows you also to post your

articles.

You can write articles here and I

mentioned this before in affiliate

marketing.

So if you don't have a website, you don't

have money to start affiliate marketing,

you can use medium.com as your own

website

to post your articles and promote

affiliate links.

Now, my point here is simply to go and

create an account 'sign

up' and then click on 'write a story' and

again

copy your article, the title go here, paste

the title,

and paste your article here. Again just

copy the content

and paste. Inside medium paste the full

article and

publish it on medium. So these are the

first

three websites- linkedin articles,

Quora spaces, and medium.com to publish

your stories or articles.

Okay, now the main question you may ask,

anyone can ask,

okay i published and copied and pasted

my articles

on these website, how i will get the

traffic? Where is the relation?

This is really super important.

Why? Simply because an example, medium, if

you go here to similar web,

it gets around 223 million

monthly visits. If you go here to Quora,

it gets around 500 million visits.

If you go to linkedin, it gets around

let's see around 1 billion

visits per month. Okay,

so the first benefit is-

If someone is searching on linkedin for

a topic,

he may find your article. If someone is

searching on quora

for a topic, he may find your article. If

someone is searching on medium,

he may find your article. So this is the

first benefit.

Number two that those websites- quora,

linkedin, and medium

has a very high rank on google, high

authority.

So your article may also rank on google

through these websites, instead of your own

website,

which is still new and have no rank on

google.

And this is really very important so you

can get free organic traffic

from search engines into your articles.

Now we still have a problem. You may tell

me okay i got traffic

into medium, into quora, and to linkedin.

But how i can get traffic back

into my website? Simply you have

to create internal links. If you go here

to my article again as you scroll,

you will see I have a link here. You will

see i have links here links links links

to my own article,s to my own services, to

my own websites.

So anyone reading the article on quora,

on linkedin,

on medium, can simply link back or can

simply go back into your website.

And this is how you can get free traffic

from these websites.

So this is the main benefit here, is to

get free organic traffic into your

articles

and link back into your website. And

simply and this I think more important

than traffic also,

whenever you write on those websites and

you start getting followers

people reading about your content, about

your services, about

your business, you are doing simply brand

awareness.

You are simply letting people know about

you, know about your business.

So they will go and visit if you like

your content. And here it comes

one important point is to publish real

value.

Not long value! Real value! It may be a

small paragraph

but it will be real value for your

followers.

So these are the main three websites

linkedin, quora and medium.com.

Go now, it will take you less than five

minutes to publish the same articles

from your blog

into these websites. Now we will move on

to the second three websites

that are somehow easier. Where we only

publish

the links of the articles. The first

website in the second list

is mix.com. You can see mix.com.

Simply, sorry simply inside mix, click on

this plus icon

and paste your article blog. As an

example, this

one. Paste it here and click on,

wait a little bit, and this is the

article. You can see it will

fetch everything. Click on mix and now

you can add to collection and publish

your article on mix.com. Mix also gets

around

1.4 million visits per month, which is

also

very good. It's from the US, so it's a

good traffic source.

Publish also all your links, all your

articles constantly

on mix.com. The second website is

pinterest.com. I know

everyone here knows pinterest, but

pinterest is really very powerful in

terms of traffic.

Why? Simply because in pinterest people

use the search

feature a lot, not like facebook and

other social platforms. Here people use

the search to find

things they are interested in. So simply

here click on 'create', after you sign up,

if you don't have an account

and click on create a pin and simply

enter the url of your blog here and the

title

so as an example here is the title of my

article. Paste it here. You can write a

small description if you want.

And you need to create an image now. The

best way to create an image for

pinterest

is to use canva.com. Canva is the best

best application. I use to create all my

designs, my ads, everything.

Simply in canva click 'create a design'

and select. Just search for pinterest

and simply select pinterest pin and then

it will give you the best size for the

pinterest

pins and it will give you templates a

lot of templates.

You can simply create your own one if

you want and i will give you now a

simple

tip as an example here in my blog. I

created this featured image, you can see

it,

it's here in my it's here in my camera

profile. I will open it now

you can simply if you created the design

inside canva

go here to the resize section and then

select

pinterest pin and click copy and resize

and now canva will resize this so simply

can drag and drop

this like this and whatever add some

things and

simply download this simply download it

and then publish it into

your pinterest account. So also go now

and start publishing every day

one or two pins into pinterest using

this strategy.

It will take less than 30 seconds to do

this on pinterest.

So this is the second website or the

fifth website today.

The last website, number six and I think

it's one of the best

it requires somehow some more work like

four or five minutes.

it is slideshare.net. It allows you to

create

and publish small slides or small ebooks.

So what you are going to do here in this

website

is to upload a small version of your

article. As an example

I have this article here so I go to

canva

and if you go here to my instagram

folder,

just to show you this instagram post as

an example,

this is the affiliate marketing article

on my blog.

I created this small version of it you

can see it

is page 2 3 4

5 pages simple you can here click on

download and

select pdf you can see pdf standard

you can download this pdf, you can create

a small version of the article

to explain what the article is about and

simply go to slideshare

and upload it. Slideshare gets around

182 million views so it's also one of

the best websites to publish

on and get traffic from. You can publish

the pdfs and link back to your website.

So these are my six websites please

please please just try it go now to the

comments section

comment below your daily visitors today

and after 10 days of applying this

strategy come back

and tell people how much visitors you

got from this strategy from these

websites

so it can motivate each other and help

each other

to improve and get more traffic. Please

try it it's super simple

totally free it takes like 10 or 15

minutes, just try it,

and you will see the results. So these

are my six websites

now it's time for the bonus website for

29,Misleading,"you don't have any online skills no budget 
with zero dollars you have no websites you  

have nothing and you want to start your online 
business today can you still make money online  

short answer a big yes in this video i 
will show you how to start from scratch  

you don't need a website you don't need any 
budget you don't need any online skills you  

just need to follow up with me in this 
short video where i will show you exactly  

a strategy to make money online even from the 
first month or more than that even from the first  

week not only that in this video i have a $50 cash 
giveaway for you as i promised in each video i  

will try my best to run a giveaway to help you as 
much as i can so stay tuned and follow up with me

hi everyone i'm hasan from h-educate and today 
i'm so excited that i published this new video  

where i will show you exactly how you can 
make money online even with no skills with  

zero dollars budget so i don't like wasting time 
let's go directly and explain our strategy but  

before please don't forget to subscribe now to 
my channel turn on notifications to get every new  

update almost every day so let's go directly to 
the point and see how this strategy works simply  

whenever you want to make money online or even 
offline the general strategy is selling a product  

so that's simple we have a product and we have 
an audience that love to buy this product so  

you sell them this product it's so simple now 
you may tell me we have a main problem here  

that i don't have a product to sell and i don't 
have any audience because i don't have any website  

no youtube channels i didn't work online before i 
want to start today so the main two problems here  

is that we don't have a product and we don't have 
an audience so we need traffic to a product and  

we need a product so this is simply the scenario 
what i'm going to show you in this video is how to  

get a product is how to get a selling page and how 
to get an audience and get traffic to this product  

so you can sell this product wow i said product 
more than 10 times i think if you didn't get it  

don't worry just wait with me only 5 minutes 
and you will see how you can make money from  

the first week even if you follow this strategy 
look to be honest with you i must say these words  

90% of people watching this video or any course 
or video on youtube will not apply what they learn  

they are maybe afraid to apply or maybe 
they are just lazy only 10% will try this  

and from this 10% only 5% will succeed why? 
because they will have that will to continue  

and work for at least one month what i'm going to 
show you now really requires only maybe one hour  

a day for only one month to see direct results 
i'm not telling you i will not lie to you now  

and tell you you will make $10,000 or $5,000 
even though it's possible but in 90% of cases  

you will earn like $100 or$ 200 or maybe 
up to $500 from the first one or two months  

but this budget that you will earn like these 
$300 dollars or $200 will be used to grow online  

so then you can run paid ads so please stick with 
me and try your best just give that one hour per  

day to apply what i will teach you in this video 
so as i mentioned we have mainly two problems  

we need a product and we need traffic 
let's start by solving the first problem  

that we want a product of course you don't 
have a product if you have it's perfect  

but i think as a beginner you don't have anything 
so from where you can get a product to sell simply  

the best choice is to go with affiliate marketing 
here is to find affiliate products now i will go  

to my screen and show you four examples and one is 
so simple to use and it's available in any country  

if one of these options is not available so 
let's go together and see these four examples  

number one is clickbank clickbank is maybe number 
one affiliate marketplace you can simply go to  

clickbank.com and sign up and then go here to 
shop click on the shop and you'll find a lot a  

lot a lot of products to sell we can simply go 
here and see like arts entertainment languages  

we have a lot of products to sell we have ebooks 
games accessories applications whatever you want  

you can see here we have a lot of products 
so simply sign up to clickbank and go and  

select a product to promote now in this video 
i can't go with each service and sign up and  

show you in detail the procedure but just to get 
the idea now we need a product we have clickbank  

as an awesome place to get a product if clickbank 
is not available in your country you can go with  

an alternative also a big affiliate service 
or company is cj affiliate i work with cj also  

it's perfect i promote some web hosting company 
services and so on so simply go to cj affiliate  

and go and find also a product to promote now 
in this video my main point is to show you  

the easiest alternative as a beginner so let's 
say you don't want to go with clickbank or cg  

affiliate these big companies we can go with an 
awesome alternative which is warrior plus before  

i show you this awesome website i want to show you 
my dashboard to give you some motivation so in the  

affiliate section here click on dashboard and here 
we are you can see i made like 600 last 30 days  

believe me without using my website without 
using my youtube channel just following  

the strategy i will show you now so this is 
warrior plus let's go back to the main screen  

and what you are going to do now simply is go 
back to affiliate here and go to offers so you  

need to check what offers are available to promote 
let's go here down and you'll get a big table of  

products and services with conversion rate with 
visitor value average sales refund rate so you  

can pick the best product to promote as an example 
let's see here sort by maybe sales how many sales  

you can see now like this one zero hour work day 
got 25,000 sales with conversion rate up to 13%  

you can see average sale is around $2 so you just 
pick a product that fits you fits you maybe what  

you love maybe you love about nutrition about 
gaming about digital marketing just search for  

a product that fits you and you want to promote 
as an example in my case like here we have this  

product thumbnail blaster it has around 7,500 
sales with value visitor up to $5 it's around $37  

so 4% refund rates somehow a good product click 
on this offer and here is the offer page what  

you are going to do simply is click on request 
approval here just click on request approval and  

the company this the author of this application 
will approve you and also you can view the sales  

page here let's open it so here is the sales page 
so as we can see we don't need a website because  

the sales page is ready for you you just want to 
copy this sales page link from your account and  

promote it i don't want to waste more time on 
this i just want you to understand the strategy  

so just get an affiliate offer we have a lot of 
products here to promote just get the best one  

you feel i will sure create a specific video about 
choosing the best products and going in details  

but in this video is not the best time to do this 
now it's not a full course so just pick a product  

and then get the link of the page the sales page 
and now we need to promote it okay i think the  

idea is somehow so simple we got a product we 
solve the first problem we have the product and  

we have the sales page the landing page so you 
don't need to worry about any website now or any  

products we solve the first issue now the main 
problem the second main problem is how to get  

visitors how to get audience how to get traffic 
to the sales page so you can get some conversions  

we need at least to get like maybe 5,000 or 10,000 
visitors per month to our sales page so we can get  

some conversions and see numbers like the ones 
i showed you in dashboard like $500 or $400 per  

month now since you have no websites you don't 
have any youtube channel no audience no email list  

you have nothing the easiest path to get traffic 
is simply two places forums and q & a sites  

please concentrate well in this spot this is the 
main part of your work the first part will maybe  

take 10 minutes of the full month you just get 
some products in 10 minutes and now the real work  

starts you need to promote this you need to work 
like 30 minutes or one hour per day promoting this  

service or this product the best place to start 
with as i told you is forums and q & a sites and  

one of the best is simply Quora number one q & 
a site on this planet on earth and the second  

website is reddit i think you know reddit look 
if we go into quora and click on the similar web  

extension we can see we have up to 500 million 
views per month and we have 71 rank in the U.S  

you know 50% of this number is from the U.S so 
it's a high high targeted traffic we have people  

here who can buy things online easily so it's 
a very important place to start with to promote  

your product and as you will see when you start 
you can get results from the first day look at  

my stats here just go here to my profile to stats 
let's go to the seven days you can see here like  

i have 2,600 views, 2,000 views you can see up 
to 2,000 views per day i told you i need 5,000  

views per month here we have 2,000 views per day 
so it's awesome if you go to my profile click on  

my profile you can see 65,000 views this month 
225 content views so quora is an awesome place  

to start with if you want to promote anything 
and grow online the second website is reddit  

reddit if you go here to similar web you will see 
now a really exciting number 1.5 billion visitors  

rank 11 in the U.S so reddit and quora are the top 
two websites to start with if you want to promote  

a service but but and but forget about spamming 
because you will destroy everything just give one  

hour a day or maybe even 30 minutes a day without 
spamming and you will see results from the first  

even week please focus well with me and don't 
waste your time with spamming so we have now quora  

and reddit what you are going to do simply on 
quora answering questions related to the product  

as an example the product here is about growing 
youtube thumbnail i don't know what anything  

so you will search about youtube questions as 
an example grow youtube anything search for this  

keyword and you will find a lot a lot of questions 
about this topic you can simply go and answer  

these questions as i told you don't spam just give 
real value now you tell me i don't know anything  

about this topic i love it but i don't know 
anything simply you can just get this question as  

an example who has the fastest growing channel 
on youtube whatever you can simply copy this  

question and paste in google and just search and 
read about this question and rephrase it and then  

post your answer again just give some 
value and then you can mention your links  

now as a best practice on quora don't 
mention your links in each answer so  

each day you are going to answer like five 
to ten questions and you will mention your  

links in only one or two questions so not to 
get banned or not to be classified as spammer  

okay so answer five questions so for each five 
answers put one link in your answers other great  

tip to go with quora is to go with spaces spaces 
is like groups in quora where people are talking  

about a specific point let's go here to youtube 
marketing as an example so here you can also post  

an article a small article or whatever so instead 
of having your own blog or having your own website  

you can post your small blog posts here inside 
quora for free and get a lot of traffic believe  

me you will get a lot of traffic i'm telling 
you this after more than one year experiencing  

quora and how it works i explained this in detail 
quora best practices and how to use quora and a  

full detailed video here on my channel please go 
and watch it it's very important to understand  

how quora works so tip number one search 
for questions tip number two go with spaces  

a small tip also let's go back to grow youtube 
any keyword you can go here to the last to the  

last week or past day so you will be the first 
one to answer a question did you get the point  

so just search for new questions and answer them 
so people will see your answers first so this is  

about quora it really works i'm telling you 
this it really works i get thousands of views  

every day from quora to my website to my 
offers to my products to my youtube page  

i get thousands of views so please go now and 
check quora it's awesome it's not my website i'm  

not promoting anything i'm just trying to help you 
i'm just sharing with you what really works online  

this is what 90% of successful people do online 
when they start to get some more traffic the  

second website is reddit now to be honest with you 
i don't use reddit that too much maybe like once  

per two weeks and so on but it's really an awesome 
website to get traffic from here you can find  

something called reddits like if you want go 
to youtube here and search for some communities  

that you can post also something it helps people 
and share your links on reddit also don't go and  

spam just try your best to help people answer 
their questions share your valuable information  

and then you can share some links to get some 
sales so as i told you i don't use reddit that  

too much you can see my karma is around 3000 
it's somehow good but i can do much much more  

with it if you if i want but i really i don't 
have that much time to go that also be beside my  

main online business anyway so we have quora 
and reddit as the first place where you can get  

traffic for free and fast from the first day to 
your offers or your products or whatever you want  

so i think in this way i solved the two problems 
you don't need a website you can get the sell page  

directly from warrior plus and you can promote 
then on quora and on reddit by sharing valuable  

info answering people's questions and sharing 
the links now as a good practice a small tip  

if you want just don't share the affiliate link 
directly you can create maybe a small blog post  

also for free using a website called blogger 
this is optional but i think it's somehow  

a good tip to go with go to blogger.com it's a 
company by google where you can create a blog  

totally for free even without a domain whatever 
you want just log in with your gmail account i  

create a small page where you can share more 
details about the offer and the offer link  

and paste inside quora and reddit i know i 
mentioned a lot of details and information  

but the main strategy i think is somehow clear 
going in detail in each topic requires um maybe  

two hours course i will try my best to publish 
more videos and more videos about this topic  

and how to grow in detail but you know that i 
have a lot of videos and topics on my schedule  

i will try my best to add this also one last tip 
before i end this video and go to the giveaway i  

want to tell you if you don't want to go with 
companies like cj affiliate or warrior plus or  

clickbank you can go with direct affiliate 
products like as an example getresponse an  

email marketing company you can see here we have 
two programs and get response and both are great  

whenever someone sign ups to get response using 
your link to a paid plan you will get $100  

one-time payment or you can get recurring 
commission every month 33% for each sale  

this is perfect so also you can go with these 
affiliate programs and go to quora and answer  

questions about email marketing or even you 
can go to an email marketing space go here  

and search for an email marketing space an example 
or a marketing space and do a comparison between  

like getresponse and mailchimp and then you can 
mention the getresponse offers inside your post  

in quora or on reddit so this is how things work 
get a product promote it with quora and reddit and  

i promise you if you do this correctly you will 
see results from the first week i promise that  

from the first week you can get your first couple 
of sales and you can make at least like one or  

two hundred dollars from the first month if you 
do this if you do what i told you in this video  

so that's it let's go now to our giveaway 
for this video we have a $50 cash giveaway  

if you want to enroll just comment below ""i am in 
the giveaway"" and like the video and see you soon

two providing an seo report for any website number 
three designing html5 advertisements what simply  

if you go now to my website as an example let's 
go to my blog here and open H-supertools.com

by the wayH-supertools is a free platform that 
contains free 100% free seo and digital marketing  

tools go and check it right now if you haven't 
before anyway let's open any tool now youtube  

keyword tool and here you can find these ads you 
can see this one this one this one all these are  

html5 ads so maybe someone will ask you to design 
an ad for him to publish on his website or he  

he want to create a google ad campaign or whatever 
and he want a design now you tell me i'm not  

a designer how can i design such ads and i don't 
have any experience before in graphic design or ad  

design or html5 so simple before i go i just want 
to show you another example you can see here this  

other ad there's another ad here on my blog so 
simply go to website called bannersnack.com  

an awesome website to create banners and 
ads with a drag and drop editor and a huge  

library of templates i will log in now 
to my account it allows you to create  

google ads facebook ads native ads a lot of 
kinds you'll see now click on i will log in  

and here we are this is my library i will 
now create a new design make a design here  

and you can see a lot of sizes templates 
you can start from for instagram for youtube  

for snapchat for twitch for a lot of applications 
and services let's now select anything  

like this one here medium rectangle and you'll 
get this empty template and now you can go here to  

templates we have animated and static templates we 
can simply select any of these templates in this  

library we have a lot of templates you can 
see here it's like the category let's say  

as an example e-commerce and select 
any of these let's say this one here  

so this is the ad here you can see it and you 
can just edit this change the title change the  

buttons and change the colors and so on you can go 
to animated and select like this one is an example  

you can see this animated ad start 
from this and you will have this ad  

you just need to edit it 
just maybe change the logo  

maybe edit this text and so on and then you can 
download as html5 ad or you can publish directly  

if you go here back to my workspace you will see 
my ads here let's say this one here click on view  

so this is the ad you can simply give 
him the embed code so he can directly  

embed on his website you can see it here can give 
responsive scale just copy this code and give it  

to the user who is requesting this service and 
he can publish directly on his website without  

worrying about speed or downloading uploading and 
so on you can give him the code directly or if  

you want you can just export this template here a
jpeg png html mp4 whatever you want and give it to  

the user so this is service number three providing 
and designing html5 ads with no experience number  

four is fiverr arbitrage or reselling services 
what do we mean by this you know we have a lot  

of websites providing freelancing services 
like freelancer.com like upwork like fiverr  

and so on so the idea here is to publish a gig 
on fiverr as an example or on freelancer and then  

resell it so you find a cheap gig here like for 
maybe five dollars ten dollars twenty dollars  

on fiverr here and then you publish on freelancer 
with a higher cost or higher price so and you  

earn the difference between the two prices as 
an example a lot of my followers contacted me  

said Hasan hey we use your applications your 
software to provide service on fiverr so as an  

example here i provide on my website these four 
servers like email validation like advertising  

let's say this one here i promote your business 
with native ads for around 99 dollars for one  

month you can see this a service i provide on my 
website so you can simply publish a gig on fiverr  

with the same service description and then you buy 
the service from here and publish on fiverr and  

you add a difference you can as an example publish 
it with 120 dollars or 150 dollars and so on  

so go and find a service on fiverr and publish 
it somewhere else or find it on other websites and  

publish it on fiverr and then you can end like 
a commission or the difference between the two  

prices i hope the idea is somehow simple so in 
this way you will not worry about any skills and  

experience anything you just order it from here 
and published on the second website and you earn  

the price difference number five is commenting on 
blogs anyone now can open a blog post and comment  

on a blog if you go here to fiverr and let's 
search for blog comments or whatever you will  

find a lot of people will tell you i will give 
you high quality backlinks using blog comments i  

will comment on whatever blogs about these niches 
and so on so simply you can provide this service  

on fiverr by commenting on others blog so let's 
go to my blog as an example let's say i told you  

i want this service i want you to comment on my 
blog like twice a week or maybe three times a week  

and so on from different accounts so you simply 
up on my blog you go and open any article here  

and you read the article and then you go down 
here and comment on this blog i think the idea  

is somehow so simple you just provide a service 
by commenting on others blog this will help blog  

owners get more backlinks and increase the 
authority and the rank of their website so  

it's somehow an seo service but you are providing 
a simple task which is commenting on others blogs  

i hope the idea is somehow simple this five ideas 
with no experience no skills zero knowledge you  

can start working today on fiverr or any 
other freelancing website and start as a  

freelancer online and make money online i wish 
you the best please don't forget to read a book  

every day on booksandmore.blog and change 
your life and boost your knowledge see you later

31,Misleading,"Let's say you have a list of 1000 email addresses

And you sell a product for just ten dollars

And your conversion rate is only one percent

You can simply earn a hundred dollars in a few minutes by sending a single email

Now let's imagine that you have 100,000 email addresses on your list.

The price of your products is fifty dollars or one hundred dollars

And your conversion rate is around two to three percent.

Imagine the number you can get by sending an email marketing campaign

Today in this course I will show you how to make money step by step through emails

Think of it as the ultimate guide to email marketing

Some people think emails are dead today in 2022

Simple answer is the best marketing strategy

To get more visitors and grow your business

And to earn more money online

keep watching

Hello everyone, Emma Hasan from H-educate

And you are watching the tenth part of our wonderful new series

Create an online business from scratch with me

To get to 2000 per month

If you follow along, you know that we built our website and learned a lot

About getting visitors, writing blog posts, and more

Today you will see how we can harness the power of emails to grow our business

Earn money online and get more visits to our website

This is my website I built with you embounce.com

About Email Marketing and Email Validation

Three articles have been published so far

I hope you accompany us

Because in six months we will see our first recipe

And I'm doing my best to get to $2000 before December 2022

So anyway, without wasting any more time

What do we have today?

The first step we need to understand the email marketing system

How it works

Of course, we're not talking spam here.

Talking about a true email marketing strategy

Build a real audience, build a real business and make real money

The idea is simple, now we have a website and we are building our business

While we are building our business and website, we need to build our audience.

One of the best ways is to build an email list.

is to have a contact list

Where you can contact them anytime to get more visits

To get more sales, maybe connect with them to ask questions or do surveys and anything

So what am I going to do now in this video

I will show you step by step how to build your email list

Attracting customers, how to get started and everything in between

Let me give you the example and then let's apply it

Here I will go to my website H-educate.com

My current site, I will open a sample page to show an example

You can see here that I am giving away some free e-books

If someone now clicks that download button

A popup form will open

He will tell you to download this e-book

You have to enter your name and email and click download

What's happening here is that I'm collecting these email addresses

Create my own email list

to simplify things

When you want to build an email list, you want to offer something

And in return you can get anyone's email address

This thing you offer is called an attractive magnet

What is the thing that attracts people to sign up for your email list

So the first step is to build something attractive

You need to create something that you will give people in exchange for their email addresses.

Let's do it now in this video

The second step is for you to build your email lists.

So the third step is to simply send campaigns

Let's see and do it step by step now

The main can be anything

If you follow here on my channel maybe 1 year or 16 months ago I posted this case study

Lead Generation Course How I Built a List of 10,000 Emails in 1 Month

A year ago I showed that when I created this application

super email sender

I used this app as a magnet

But an attractive magnet can be just about anything.

Free ebook, app, course or video

Or anything of value you can offer people

So I think the easiest magnet you can create is a free mini ebook

how much? Just go to canva.com

If you're following me, you know I use canva, it's one of the best apps on the internet

Go here to create a design and click here and write a book here

Then click on the book cover

And it will give you the ebook size automatically

And you can start creating a free ebook

Now here you have two options

They are creating a free ebook or magnet from scratch

create your own book

Or you can go to the PLR ​​sites

If you go here and type PLR ​​sites

And let's go to PLRproducts freePLRdownloads

We have many products

They are simply products that you can reuse

As an example, let's move here to this site

Go here for ""free ebooks""

You will find many things here

Say for example ""Google Analytics 101""

It is a free e-book that you can download absolutely free of charge and you have the right to use

But as a little tip when you download an eBook, don't use it as is.

Just make some changes or import them into canva

Or copy and paste into Microsoft Word PowerPoint or whatever you want and make some changes to it

Anyway, in my case what I did was write a small article on my blog here

In all posts about how to warm up an SMTP server

Forget it now, just focus on the idea

I will use this article to turn it into a free ebook

I'll click preview here so I can easily copy the text

let's start copying

ctrl + c then go here

I'll add a page and then just paste it

Just resize like this

write line 24

So we have this first part, let's say 32

after a decade

You can also get pictures if you want

Save the image to your desktop

Go here and add space

And we can go to the download section to download the media

and load the image

So this is the first page of the e-book

And you can just add anything like text or anything

I will say here embounce.com

So this is the first page of the e-book

In the same way you can copy the whole article of course not my article I mean your article

Or any magnet you build and create with canva

Now to save time I'm going to do a magic to finish the e-book on canva

One two Three

Now I have a ten page e-book

Excellent we still have the cover

Let's create a cool and attractive cover

The cool thing about canva is that we have a lot of templates here

We can choose between them, let's see what we have

I will choose this

I'll change the name and put my name here

What is the title of the ebook

OK

I will say here embounce.com

You can change this image if you want

Let's see what we have in the items

Email

let's download this

and here we are

I created a free ebook using canva based on the article

I also told you if you don't have an article and if you want something free and fast

You can access PLR websites.

Download free ebooks

Please enter your pledge

I think the idea is very simple

So now we have our own attractive magnet

Let's download in pdf

And by the way, you don't need a screen to do this.

You can do this with PowerPoint with Microsoft Word

or whatever you want

I think canva is quite easy and that's why I use it

So now we have this pdf file

And this is a free ebook that we can use as a magnet

So we finish the first step

We have the magnet and now we can give it to people

To start building our email list

let's see how

But wait a minute, before we start collecting email addresses.

When we collect these email addresses, we want to save them somewhere

We want something to manage our email list

We need an email marketing service

If you follow me on my channel I already explained Getresponse and convertkit

I explained many services

And last week I did a lot of research to find something you can get started with absolutely free.

Ex

As promised, I will do my best to find free services and free tools to start this business.

'Cause I know a lot of you can't put a lot of money into this

So one of the best free email marketing services

And building mail funnels is systeme.io

If you go here for prices

You will see that we have a free plan

Allows you to have up to 2,000 contacts

I think this is the only service that lets you add 2000 contacts absolutely for free

Unlimited emails can be sent

You can create sales funnels

Email campaign automation posts and rules

It's all in the free plan

So go now and get started for free with systeme.io

Already registered if you don't have an account just go and register

You will find a link in the description if you want

And you can see I deleted everything on this panel

'Cause I want to start with you from scratch

I don't have any contact

Today I will start building my email list with you guys in this new business

This service will allow you to manage your contacts

To build a sales funnel, send email newsletters and more

Usually when you want to collect and build an email list we have two main methods

The first is to create a funnel

A landing page that will be used to collect these email addresses

And you will do it now

The second method is while someone is reading your articles on your website.

As I showed before, a popup will appear where people can enter their email addresses

To follow you or to get your magnet and so on

Let's now implement these two methods

Let's start with the first method which is to create a custom landing page

Just go here for the conversion paths in systeme.io

Create a new sales funnel

In the objective here I choose to build an audience

We're just here to build an email list, to build an audience.

we will not sell anything

We'll call it here Create an Embounce Audience

Create and now it will create the funnel for you

You can see the compression page

The squeeze page is the first step where people will enter their email addresses

And on the thank you page you will tell people thanks for signing up or so on

Or direct them to a specific page

Anyway let's do it now squeeze page we have a lot of templates here

So we provide an e-book here so here we have this landing page

Let's take a look, you can see

We can add the e-book photo here in the blank space here

This is their address, first name and email and they can download the ebook here

So what we are going to do is select this model

So we can modify this

Click on Edit Page, now we will have the Page Editor

It's very simple by the way

We have this sample image and we are going to change it for the cover of our ebook

I will return here to canva.com for the ebook download page

I go here click download

And here I will choose png

Just select the first page and download

Now I will go back to the editor and I will simply upload my photos

In downloads, here is the image insert and you can see the image here

Let's change the background color to something brighter like this

And let's copy the address from here

and paste here

Enter your name to get this free e-book.

First name then download now

That's it, save your changes

let's go back to the system

Now we create a squeeze page

You see how simple it is you can add the url if you want

By the way, you can add your own website

If you access your account settings here

You will see that we have dedicated websites

We can add our custom domain here

Add a website, I'll say funnel.embounce.com

I will use a subdomain

Save and now you need to configure your dns

I will move here to my sites, to ambush

for DNS settings

We want to validate the site with systeme.io

So I'll copy this and move here

To add a Cname pointing to this address

I will copy the funnel

and paste here

and save it and again add another Cname

copy this

and paste here

Copy and paste here and save

And don't forget that I always remind you, if you have any questions or something unclear

I'll be here almost every day on Telegram and on the forum waiting for your questions

So go now and join us at H-educate.com/forums

On Telegram you will find the link in the description below

Then we add cname records

Now you need to wait a while until the verification is completed

Anyway, let's get back to work

So you can change your location if you want

I will write here Embouncefunnel and then save

So this is the squeeze page

So we have a thank you page

let's see what we have here

Let's see it

It's all set now, thanks for signing up

And you can add a link to your Facebook group

As this model shows

Maybe for your youtube channel and whatever you want

I don't want to waste too much time here

I think you get the idea. You can experiment and create your own designs and implement them

Now the main idea is on the click here page

In the rules of automation

When someone signs up, you need to add them to your contact list and tag them

So here in the automation rules go and add a rule

Click ""Subscription Email Path""

Add an action and I'll add a tag

What is the tag? It is simply something that describes the contact

You can see here you can choose a sign

So let's create a tag I'll go to the contacts here

Then for the tags

Add a new tag and I'll call it Preparing your list of prospects

As an example to let me know this contact signed up using this magnet

Come back here and refresh this page

I'll move on to the automation rules

Add an action and then add a tag

I would choose the magnet

So when someone signs up for this form, I'll tag them

So I need to send the magnet of attraction to this contact

You can do this on the thank you page

For example, when you specify this

You can edit this and join the facebook group here

You can say ""Download your e-book""

As an example and this url will be the url of your e-book

So you can just go here to google drive

And let's download our e-book

This is the e-book in pdf format

ok then share

I'll say change it with whoever has the link

You can see it, so copy the link

Then go here again to systeme.io

and paste the url, it's that simple

Now when someone signs up they will receive the e-book

And you will have the email in your email list

Let's test this, I'll open this page

I will enter my name and my gmail account and download now

We are ready Download your e-book

We can see now that I have an e-book

And if we come back here

In systeme.io under contacts you will now see that my email is registered

And this is the sign, you can see it

I was tagged with this tag

So it's so simple now that we have our first mail route

We may use it to collect email addresses

The main question now is how are we going to promote this email route?

That's ok, but now you can get this title, it's completely free

You can use it to promote this ebook and start collecting mailing addresses

You can promote this on your website

Or wherever you want to build your audience

Now the second way is to create a popup signup form

While someone is reading it will appear and the email can be collected

how do you do let's see

Go back to Funis here

I will create a new mail path

Create, build an audience

Now you can select the location You can see it, I checked the location

I will select this site

Example of a popup

accumulate

Now here I will delete the squeeze page, confirm

I will create a new step and call it popup

And in type make sure you select a popup form

Save and check this form before the thank you page

And you can see now that we have a lot of models too

I will choose this

Select it and again you can edit that, edit the page and anything

Get this free ebook

I don't want to repeat it now again, the idea is just to change this form and then save the changes

Go back to the system and now what you are going to do is go to the script

And copy this little text back to your blog

I'm going through the posts here just to show you how to do this

Let's say you want this popup to appear while someone is reading this article

Click Edit and now scroll down here to the end of the article

I will add a new block

I will choose html

Then type and paste the script here

Update and now we will show the post

Open up, see what happens now

While someone is scrolling and reading this article

This popup will appear

Users can sign up and get the free ebook in this popup

they can close like this

So this is how you can implement both a squeeze page like this

Or a popup form with Systeme.io absolutely free

And add it to your website

So we finish the second stage

What is the main step on how to build email lists

The third step is to start sending email marketing campaigns

You can go here for newsletters or advertising campaigns

And start sending to your contact list

So now let's dig a little deeper and talk about some more advanced tips.

What will help you when creating your campaigns, email lists and much more

So if you follow me you know I use a service called convertkit

It is one of the best email marketing services

Also, convertkit has a free plan

You can start with zero dollars up to 300 subscribers

What's the idea?

Go to my dashboard in convertkit

You can see my email list has around 4200 contacts

my average opening is 45%

The average click through rate is 12%

Not bad, now I'm going to show you how to create a custom popup form

To collect email addresses within convertkit

In case you want to use a slightly advanced method on your website

This is not mandatory, but I must make this clear to get the most out of this course.

So I'm going back here to the site I'm building with you

In this series embounce.com

I will go to plugins and add a new plugin

This time we have a paid plugin

It's optional but I use this plugin and it's great

That's why I'm sharing it with you

If you return to my website H-educate.com

You can see it's called Master Popsup

And the cool thing about Master Popsup is that you can buy it from Code canyon. It's a one-time payment

$39 if you can buy it go buy it

If you can't, fine.

I already bought this and I will download this plugin

To install on my site

Anyway, follow us, you will learn a lot of tips now

that you can later implement on your website

This is the compressed file. Let's go back to my website

And we load a plugin, choose the file

Click here to install now

By the way, some of you asked me about this SMTP mailing plugin error

We will fix it in the next video

So don't worry about it now

And don't forget if you have any questions or anything else I'm active almost every day on Telegram

And on the forum, go now and join us

Let's talk and help each other

So the plugin has been successfully installed and I will activate the plugin now

Very cool Master Popup

Go here for general settings to enter license

So this warning will show here

Click here, go to activate plugin here

It is not activated. Enter your username in envato

What is your username in code canyon

In the purchase code I will go here for my downloads

So here download the license file

Then I will copy the purchase code

Then go here and paste and validate your purchase

Sorry, I failed simply because I already used this license on my other site

Anyway, that's fine, I'll show you how to do it on my current site in H-educate

The first thing you need to do is connect Master-Popsup to your email marketing service

So if you go to general settings again

You will see that we have many services, up to 51 services

So whatever email marketing service you use, you can plug it into this great software.

And you can see here that convertkit is already built in and you can connect mailchimp

Up Mailster Up mailwizz e mautic

If you follow my email marketing videos

You know I've talked about many of these services before

Just click on the service you want to integrate

Then you need to copy and paste the api key

Now in convertkit in your account if you go here in settings

Then advanced options, you will see the api key here

Just copy and paste inside this field, inside Master Popsup

And are you ready like this

So we connect Master Popsup to our Email Marketing Service

Now go here and click on new popup

I won't go into details now.

I want to give an overview if you want to use this service or this program

You can do this and it's quite easy.

The first thing you need to add is the title, let's call it ""sample popup""

Then go here for ""Popup Templates""

You will find many ready-made templates

So pick one, I pick this one and then import

To accept

Let's go back to the general options

And now you can see that this is the form that appears

You can edit the photo, name, email and whatever you want

So what you need to do is go here to form the form

So in the audience list you just need to select the one inside the convertkit you created here inside the Master Popsup

The idea is quite simple

Maybe 10-15 minutes of using this plugin

It will allow you to create and test your first popup

I don't want to waste too much time on this as I've indicated that it's optional, it's quite advanced

not needed at this time

And by the way, it has a content blocking page if you like cpa marketing

You know I think the contents closet

Let's move on now and see how we can send a campaign

Let's go back to convertkit to watch this live now

We can click ""Send"" here

""Podcasts"" to send podcasts to all your contacts

Click New Podcasts

You need to enter a subject line

The cool thing about convertkit is that it has a feature called split test aeb

If you click on it, you can use two subject lines

And send the campaign with two subject lines to see which works best

So you can improve your campaigns with the best subject line later

So you just add the content here

You can see the auto-generated unsubscribe and profile update link here

So now the big question you might be asking is how to write good email copy

Now, to help you out, I can't start a full-text writing course right now.

In this video I will give you some templates

So if you go to H-educate.com/fourums

In the Email Marketing section you will see something called Email Templates

My team and I will publish some ready-made email templates for you

Templates for cold emails, newsletters and more

You can just copy and paste it, change some words and send it with your campaigns

Within systeme.io you can simply go here to send emails and newsletters

Send Mouth

Let's log in again, create a newsletter

Write a subject line and you can use the visual editor or the classic editor

All you need to do is compose your message.

Again here is the text field and you can add whatever you want

Now inside systeme.io so far they don't have a and b split test

But I contacted the founder of systeme.io and he told me that this feature will be available soon on their platform

So if you are using systeme.io don't worry they will add this feature soon

Now, one of the main problems that every working person is email marketing faces.

It's an inbox problem

When sending a campaign, you will see a very low open rate or very low click-through rate

Which means your emails don't make it to your inbox

That's why I've published the ultimate complete guide to getting into your inbox

I will keep the link in the description below you can check out this complete guide

Walkthrough detailing what helps you access your inbox

So go and sign up and start setting up popups

Create your own landing pages and magnets

"
32,Misleading,"Her friends, Hassan from  H- Educate  ,
and you are watching three in our awesome new

series, build an online business from scratch
with me and reach at least $2000

in the spot you are going to finish.
Our website set up install our theme some plug

ins, add some pages to stay tuned
and follow up. Okay, friends, so this

is our website, a WordPress website,
and the first step is to install a theme,

the theme will give us our website
design. We installed this website in Part two,

so please, if you haven't watched
part one and two going out and watch it, it's

a full connected step-by-step
series anyway. If you have your website

configured, go to the back and WordPress
dashboard and then go here to appearance

and then themes. You will see now how
think is really super simple. Then click

on Add in you to add a new theme and you will
see inside WordPress. We have a lot

of free themes you get install
before you install any theme, you have to know

something very important. We have two
main options to select one of these themes

here, which are somehow free. Install
and activate your website, or you can go

to website called Theme Forest Dot
Net. What? He can find a lot of premium

WordPress themes, so it depends on your
budget what you are going to do. You can

go here to WordPress and select a category.
Let's say in our case, we want

something like a blog or something,
and you can see a lot of themes here.

But anyway, if you plan to go with
Theme Forest or to select one of these themes,

you have to pay attention to something
very important, which is the theme

performance. If you're going to Google
Page Speed Insights, go here,

Speed Insights, and let's go and open
my current website HBK dot com and that's all

any of our articles. Copy this link
and paste it here and analyze. You can see

my page is super fast, and this is very
important for SEO, for your websites,

for your user experience and much
more. We talk about website performance later

on indicated lecture, but for now,
just pay attention. We want to select a theme

makes you select a fast theme. Now you may
tell me how I know this. If your theme

photos always when you open any of these
themes, go and preview it. You can preview

it and test it with Google Pay
Speed Insights or simply read the reviews

the comments. Just check the theme
before you install it. But in our case today,

we are going to install a free
theme, which is super fast. It's called Neave,

and by the way, I'm using Nieve
and my main website, Étudié dot com.

So I was told this simple, clean,
fast theme on our website installed and then

activate. Of course, you can use all
the theme if you want. We have also Astra

is also fast. We have also had an element
that is also fast. We have Ocean WP

generate press. All of these themes
are super fast themes. You can use them

if you want in our case will go with
me now. If we go and refresh our website,

you will see it's somehow different.
It's super simple. We don't have content now.

We will do this later on in the series,
but for now we set up and install

our theme Just pay attention to performance
when you want to install your

theme. Let's test this. I will open
this article. Go here to Google Page Speed

Insights again to test our website
Speed Analyze, and you can see 9:06 for mobile

and 100 for desktop, which is perfect
now. The second step is to go back to your

dashboard and then go here to Settings.
Then Perma Links Burma Links allows

you to configure the structure of the You Are.
Make sure to select post name.

This is very important for SEO to get
traffic from Google later, so check

the post name, then save changes, it says.
Permalink structure updated And now

if you go here to visit our website
again and click on Helloworld, you will see

it is our website name. Slash the title
of the article. This is very important

for SEO. If you don't know what is SEO,
don't worry, we'll talk about this later

in-depth. The second step is to go hit
the general section in the settings and then

make sure to change the tag line if you want.
I would keep it empty for now,

but what's important here is to set
up your website. You are out. Make sure

to use ADB s and you website name.
So whenever someone visits your website,

they will get this. You are always
also less important for SEO and reaching your

website. Save changes. Now let's move
on to plug ins and WordPress. We have a lot

of plug ins or called add ons to get
out your website. Today, you are going

to install some important plugins. Go
to plug ins here and then go to add new plug.

The first one is called word fence.
This plug in is used to protect you website.

It's like a layer of defense to your
website. Just go here and activate it.

It's super simple. Install and activate
this plug. Pretty nice. It will take

you back to the wizard. Check this
box. Say no here without email. Enter your

email address. OK, continue. We don't
need any premium licenses saying no thanks.

And now we installed. We're friends.
Let's go to the dashboard and you can see now

we are protected. You can see on the ification
here to complete the set up.

Just. Click here to configure,
then download this user configuration file

and then continue and close. And that's
it. Now dismiss the certification and now

our firewall wall fence is configured
super simple. Now go back to plug ins

again and click on Add, then you to add
the second plug in, which is called up

draft and you can see now updraft
plus WordPress back up plug and creating back

up. So your website is very important
if you lose anything. If anything happens,

you can simply restore your data
back. So install this plugin so we can run

automated backups automatically on your
website and it's free. Activate this now.

Go here to this plug in. Click on here
to start, and you can see now we can back up

manually or simply go here to settings
and set up automatic backups. Let's say

weekly, weekly and let's retain
scheduled backups. Let's say three. Then you have

to select the storage where you are going
to save these files. You can save

on Updraft Plus Vault. It's maybe
a premium service. You can use Dropbox.

You can use your Google Drive free
account, just select whatever you want

from here. FTP server, Microsoft
OneDrive, everything, and then simply go down

and save changes. Now automatically
tell you to connect. Click on this link. I will

use my Gmail account k allow complete
set up and here we are. We connected updraft

now to Google Drive. It's that
simple. So now our website is protected as

a firewall, and it's protected
with backups with weekly backups.

So if anything happens, we can simply
restore your data. This is very important.

Before we move on, please, if you feel
this video is somehow helpful, you got

some benefit. Don't forget to smash
the like button. This will help me grow more

on YouTube. And don't forget also to join
us on Telegram. I will be the active

almost every day we can chat together,
help each other if you have any questions,

anything you want. We will be there to chat
together. The link description below.

Now let's move onto step number
three, adding common pages if you go

to our website, HBK dot com or any web
site. By the way, if you go down, we have

these common pages, privacy policy
terms and the Contact US page. If you go here

and say contact, we have this simple
contact form. Now we are going to create

these three pages and you will see how
easy it is. I will go here back to my back

and to my dashboard. Go here to pages.
And let's start with the Privacy Policy,

Page added You and then me to enter
a title for our page, say Privacy Policy.

That's it. Now you may ask from what
I will get this privacy policy. Simply go

here on a free website. Each
supertrawlers dot com and then go here to web tools.

Privacy Policy Generator What's
your website name? It is in bounds.

Website your URL. Just copy it from here
and paste it. Generate privacy policy.

And you can see now we have HMO
version and the text version here. Just scroll

down. I will copy everything like this
control c then paste here. That's simple.

Publish this page. Now, let's go back
and add a new page, which is the terms page.

I would say terms and conditions if you want
and then go back to its capital

again, the same operation term
generator, you are l let's copy it inbounds and then

generate terms. Go down here, copy
everything, control, see and then paste

here and publish. Does that simple?
Later on, of course, we may change some things

when we add affiliate links. Maybe we have
a free disclosures. We'll cover everything

down for you. But for now, there's
enough to add the Privacy Policy and the terms

page. If you go to your press and click
on the settings icon, you will see

in the page section. The permalink
is terms conditions. So just open this

and you'll see this the page now on our website.
Very easy. Let's go back, go

to Privacy Policy and a visit to your
published. If you go to the page, you will

see that we have privacy policy that
to this somehow a problem, because if you go

back to our dashboard in the pages
section, you will see that we have two

privacy policy pages. This is by default
generated by the theme, so I will remove

it and then go back here and read
this number two and update this page. And now

if you go here to view Page Privacy
Policy and this Privacy Policy page, awesome

and super easy, the last page is the contact
us page. Simply go here to plug

ends and the new plug in and then
simply search for contact for seven. And you will

see now we have contact form seven,
plug and just install it. You will see how easy

it is now activated. You see, now we have
the contact section, contact forms.

We have the default phone. I will
just copy the so-called. Copy, go to pages

at the new page. And they will say
here, contact us and paste this tag here.

It will show you the contact form
one publish and now I will click on a view

page and you'll see it. Is the contact
us page super simple and easy? Of course

we can do this. Add some images. We will
cover customizing and designing websites

later on. But for now, there's enough.
We have the Contact US page privacy policy

and terms and conditions. Of course,
we don't want them to be stuck in the menu

here. We are going to move them later
on to the footer section and change our menu

and do everything. Don't worry. But for now,
this is enough. No, I want to mention

a very important point, so please
focus very well in the last video. I mentioned

that we can get $300 a credit on Walter
so we can test anything you want. This $100

will expire as mentioned inside
Walter after 14 days, so after two weeks,

you will have to pay for hosting.
If you don't want to pay for hosting, as

I mentioned before, you can go with
blogger or today I will give you another

coupon for digital ocean, where he can
test $100 for 60 days on digital ocean.

Or if you want, you can go with
Google Cloud and get $300 and free credits

to test for one year. It's up to you,
as I mentioned before. Choose whatever

the hosting company you want. You are not
obliged to go with me. With Walter,

just giving you a small COVID test
thinks it's up to you anyway. Also, we have

a free alternative, which is WordPress
dot com. Good WordPress dot com. Then slash

you and you can create an account
and create a free WordPress website

on WordPress dot com. Of course,
would have some limitations, but OK. You can

start with and later on you can scale
up and pay for hosting or switch to another

company or whatever you want. That's a very
important point. You have to consider

and don't forget, please join us on Telegram
because everything, all of these

tips and updates and things all
of you have any blog or announcements

are mentioned in our Telegram
channel and group, so please go and join there

so we can chat together and help each
other. See you in the upcoming video.


"
33,Misleading,"hi everyone and welcome to part 
two in our awesome new series  

build an online business with me from scratch and 
reach two thousand dollars at least per month now  

after we selected our niche in the first part 
we are going to select a name for our business  

a domain name and we are going to set up our 
website so for me i selected the email validation  

niche if you didn't watch the first part please go 
now and watch it it's a full connected series so  

in part one i selected my niche which is email 
validation now i don't know what you selected  

but i will help you now to select a brand 
name go to website called nameless.com  

this service is based on machine learning and ai 
will help you to select a name so as an example  

in my case i can write email marketing whatever 
keyword you want and click on generate then you  

can select short names medium names and click on 
generate and now this awesome service will show  

you a lot of brand names to select from like this 
one remail email these are brand names you can  

select from can see how much names we have here 
awesome service by the way let's say you selected  

healthy food click on generate and now 
nameless will give you a lot of examples  

of brand names so you can get some ideas for 
your domain name or your brand name so after  

you select a list of names go to a service 
called instantdomainsearch.com and check if  

the domain is available the domain simply the 
name of your website as an example in my case  

h educate.com this name is the name of my 
website in my case i selected this name e m  

bounds e m stands for email and bounds stands for 
bounce emails so it's related to email bouncing  

which is solved by email validation you can 
see it's green so it's available if it's not  

available let's say i selected email bounce like 
this you can see it's a blue it's a premium domain  

it will give you a lot of examples also here the 
name generator to give you examples you can pick  

up from so the idea now is you have to select a 
brand name i prefer going with a small brand name  

don't say like the email validationwebsite.com it 
will be somehow complicated or not professional  

go with a short brand name that describes your 
business check it on instant domain search and  

now we have to get and buy this domain name i will 
go to godaddy.com this service allows you to buy  

and register a domain name your own domain 
name you can use any service you want like  

namecheap like enum like google domains whatever 
you want we need to get a domain that's it i will  

write here e m bounds search for this dummy it 
must be available embounds.com and you have a  

discount very nice i will click on get it continue 
to cart okay i will buy it for two years for 19  

okay i'm ready to pay i will use my credit card 
to even continue complete purchase very nice i  

got my domain and now i'm ready to set up my 
website now you may tell me i don't have the  

budget to buy a domain name if you don't 
have the ten dollars to buy a domain name  

if you really want to start you can go now and 
work on websites like picoworkers for two or  

three days and earn ten dollars to buy a domain 
name i have a full case study about this how to  

earn two or three dollars per day online working 
on peak coworkers or micro workers websites please  

go and check this video description below watch 
it start earning some dollars then you can buy  

a domain name so please you don't have an excuse 
if you really want to start with us you can do it  

you can work and earn the ten dollars so this 
part one getting a domain name the second part  

is setting up our website here we have mainly 
two choices you can go with a free method which  

is blogger.com a service from google allows you 
to create a website i explained it in detail here  

on my channel i showed you how to create a full 
website for free with google if you want you can  

do this but i prefer to go with wordpress we 
have a lot of plugins and things to help you  

scale your business later on as you will see so i 
will go with wordpress and i prefer and recommend  

to go with wordpress now before we go and set up 
our website you have to understand the concept of  

web hosting a website is a set of files written in 
a specific programming language like php asp.net  

or whatever programming language we have a set of 
files if you want these files to be accessible all  

over the globe simply put them in a public server 
put them in a place where anyone can access this  

is what we call hosting the website putting the 
website files somewhere publicly so anyone can  

access them this operation is called web hosting 
and in web hosting we have mainly two types  

vps hosting or virtual private server hosting and 
we have shared hosting in shared hosting we have  

one server that a company is managing and you will 
have a website inside the server in a vps model  

you will have a vps server for you a virtual 
private server for you you can host your website  

on and this method i will go with in this 
series because i believe vps will give you  

more performance more manageability and more 
scaling later on and i will go with a company  

called vaulter which is one of the best companies 
when it comes to vps services and what's nice i  

will give you a free code so you can start totally 
for free with this service but you are not obliged  

to do this you can go with digitalocean you can go 
with amazon web services you can go with microsoft  

azure cloud go with whatever web hosting service 
you want we don't have any restrictions here  

in my case i will go with walter so if you want 
to sign up and get a free credit go and use my  

link description below it's an affiliate link by 
the way so i will log into my account and create  

a service and you will see now how easy it is 
to create a service and don't forget please if  

you have any doubts any questions about hosting 
names anything in this series i will be active  

almost every single day on our telegram group 
so please go there we can chat together and help  

each other so here is my dashboard i will 
click on this plus icon and click on deploy  

a service click on cloud compute i will go with 
a service in frankfurt let's say it's in europe  

so it's like the center of the planet anyway go 
down and here go to marketplace apps if you are  

following and i will select wordpress what's 
nice about servers like walter or digitalocean  

they have these automated applications you select 
wordpress and they will configure everything for  

you in minutes and maybe in seconds sometimes so i 
will select wordpress i will go down i will go the  

10 machine for now later on we have more traffic 
i will scale this and i will show you how you can  

scale this easily go down and then i will simply 
enter a server host name which is my domain name  

i will copy it paste it here and then deploy now 
that's it now vaulter will create everything for  

you you can see it's installing let's wait 
a little bit then we can access our server  

to set up wordpress very nice you can see maybe 
in less than one minute we have our server running  

you can see this our ip address the ip address is 
a unique address that you can reach your server  

with so i will copy it and now i'll go back to 
godaddy to map the domain name to the ip address  

what this means now is we can access our server 
with the ip and with the domain name so we can  

give a domain name for our website i will go here 
to my account my products in godaddy it's the same  

operation almost all domain services again if 
you have problems don't worry if you are using  

something else just follow up with us on telegram 
i will try my best to help you let's see my new  

domain here we are i'll click on dns management so 
i can set the ip address what you are going to do  

simply is to edit the main a record here just 
edit this paste the ip address save and that's it  

now this server and this ip is mapped to our 
domain name so we can access our server with  

the domain name how we can verify this you have 
to wait a couple of minutes sometimes hours for  

dns migrations but if you want to verify this you 
can open cmd on your pc or command prompt and ping  

your domain name embounds.com now you can see it's 
pointing to this ipl to our server so it's working  

perfectly very nice now we are ready to configure 
and set up wordpress the basic configuration on  

our server i will click on this server now 
to open it and what's nice in walter they  

also have the documentation the installation it 
will tell you this is how you can install and log  

into your wordpress dashboard and so on to your 
php my admin everything is here and what's also  

nice you can install a free ssl directly on your 
server if you go to documentation and if you go  

down here we have installed a cell 
certificate so what you are going to do now  

is go and install an application called pull t 
you can see this putty is an stage client allows  

you to connect your server and run some comments 
i will paste my server ip here or my domain name  

since we map it embounds.com say accept and now i 
will say root what is the password let's go back  

here to see the password you can see root show 
password i will copy it and then right click to  

paste the password it will not be visible but 
it's there this for security reasons just enter  

and now we will log in to our server let's go 
back to our documentation and then we need to  

install the ssl i will go here and copy this just 
open notepad paste it here this is the command  

you see i will remove this example.com and say 
embounds.com the same for the second domain here  

and the email let's say admin at enbounds.com copy 
this control c later on we create the business  

email don't worry i will show you how to create 
this business email address copy and then paste  

here enter and let's wait a little bit now we 
have a free ssl certificate and for newbies if  

you don't know what ssl if you go to any website 
here you see this security lock it means we have  

a secure connection so we have an ssl certificate 
installed on this website this is very important  

for seo for online shops for your website for your 
clients for everyone to secure your connection  

now we finished configuration let's go again to 
installation and then open this link it will show  

you this authentication i will just copy this user

34,Misleading,"welcome to my new series build an online business 
with me today is our first lecture our first video  

in this awesome new series and we are going to 
cover two points the online business plan what we  

are going to do and the second point is selecting 
the niche of your business so please focus very  

well this video is so important because everything 
later will be based on this video before we start  

don't forget that we have a telegram group 
so we can chat together almost every single  

day if you have questions problems anything i 
will be there active every day we can help each  

other and chat with each other to be successful 
online so if you are ready let's start together  

hi everyone i'm hassan from hdk and if it's your 
first time here on my channel here you'll find  

everything related to digital marketing and online 
business but based on real case studies real  

experience and deep research and you are watching 
now a special series on how to build an online  

business from scratch following up with me so 
in a couple of months you will have a successful  

online business making around two thousand dollars 
per month so number one the plan to make things  

easy for you we are going to build an online 
business based on multiple income streams so we  

are not going to focus only on affiliate marketing 
or only on google adsense or selling products  

no we are going to build a strong connected 
business based on multiple income streams who  

are going to work with affiliate marketing google 
adsense selling digital products selling services  

sas services apis and much much more i will 
try my best to make this series number one  

on the planet so i don't think you want to miss 
this we are going to start with building the  

website monetizing it getting traffic getting new 
customers everything in detail step by step and  

you'll watch me doing this in front of you so 
it's really a challenge also for me i need to  

prove for you that this is real and you can do it 
by following step by step so this is number one  

our plan the second point is selecting the niche 
now please focus very well this is super important  

what is a niche it's simply the topic that you are 
going to talk about in your business example in my  

current business hdk.com if you are following you 
know it's all about digital marketing and online  

business these are the topics of the niche 
of my current business so what we are going  

to do now is to pick a niche for our new online 
business of course every one of you will pick his  

own niche we are going to copy each other if we 
do this we will be all competitors in my case i  

will pick a niche that you will see right now but 
before that i want to help you pick a niche the  

first step go to my website hdk.com ebooks here 
we have a free ebook about selecting the right  

niche it's simply an ebook listing a lot of 
topics and niches so you can get some ideas it's  

like collecting ideas and brainstorming topics go 
and download it it's totally free the second step  

is you have to understand the best formula of 
picking up an age it's simply something you love  

or you know about plus this something must solve 
a problem for a specific target audience plus this  

something must be monetizable if you can find a 
niche that fits in this formula it will be a great  

niche but please focus on these two very important 
tips number one is to narrow down what do i mean  

in my case i talk about digital marketing and 
online business it's very broad so we have to  

narrow down as an example in digital marketing 
we have seo we have email marketing we have  

scm or search engine marketing and so on we have 
different topics or child topics on the digital  

marketing then under email marketing we have 
different topics as an example we have sending  

bulk emails we have cold mailing we have email 
validation and so on what we are going to do is  

to narrow down and pick a specific specific niche 
to go with later on we can expand this but for now  

we want to start we are going to pick a specific 
niche to go with in our online business so let's  

say you are going to talk about dogs in dogs we 
have dog training we have dog feeding we have  

types of dogs maybe we have specific type we want 
to talk about and so on so put the broad topic  

and then go and brainstorm child topics go as 
much as narrow as you can to pick a specific niche  

in the topic you want did you get the idea please 
focus very well this is very important so later  

on we are going to create a website based on this 
specific niche and build a business based on this  

specific niche the second tip if you can achieve 
this formula plus specific topic plus high cpc  

you will get the best out of your business 
what do i mean by high cpc if you go to eight  

separate tools.com to seo keyword research 
tool let's give an example if we say here dog  

training let's say in the us search you will see 
that this keyword dog training has a cpc of 3.25  

but if we go with as an example health insurance 
in the us you will see now that this keyword has  

cpc of 15 what this means is if you are going to 
monetize later on with google adsense with ads  

your earnings will increase automatically because 
the ads published on your website will have a  

higher cpc now forget about this it's not that 
important for now but if you can achieve it from  

now it will be perfect but it's not necessary 
focus on what you love monetizable plus solves a  

problem plus narrow down these are the four most 
important factors when you want to pick a niche  

now in my case i will go with digital marketing i 
will narrow down to email marketing i will narrow  

down to email validation i will create a new 
business based on this topic email validation  

don't worry if you don't know about this topic 
it's okay it's something related to validating  

emails and email marketing we will learn about 
this later on but now it's your turn to select  

your niche so step number one go and brainstorm 
ideas you can go to h super tools the youtube  

keyword tool and write a topic as an example 
let's say crypto and now this tool will give  

you a lot of ideas like 370 keywords ideas and 
topics related to this topic so you can narrow  

down and pick a specific niche let's say dog 
training again we have a lot of keywords and  

ideas that you can pick from to select your niche 
so it's your turn now to brainstorm and search  

for the topic and go with a specific topic i know 
this video was somehow conceptual you don't have  

any practical examples because it's a concept you 
have to learn this and it's very important because  

everything later on will be based on your niche so 
take your time three four five days maybe one week  

or more just don't be in a rush select your 
niche so we can follow up later and start  

building our online business please don't forget

36,Misleading,"On May 6, 1937, when a German airship named the Hindenburg caught fire  and 35 people lost their lives  this was one of the world's biggest disasters and was considered a man-made disaster  because there was an excessive amount of hydrogen gas and 100 people should not have been seated on the world's most flammable material. this whole incident could have been avoided  Nathan Anderson, an Israeli citizen who once ran an ambulance in Jerusalem, earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Connecticut and named his company after the Hindenburg disaster in 2017,  which he calls Hindenburg Research. Nathan says that just as the Hindenburg disaster was a man-made mistake  that could have been prevented, similarly his company, Hindenburg Research aims to prevent financial man-made disasters by searching for them and saves people's money.  Before starting this company, Nathan worked with Harry Markopolos  and uncovered the biggest financial fraud in history,  Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. if you will search biggest financial fraud in the history you will see Harry's name there and at that particular time Nathon worked with Harry Hindenburg Research is a forensic financial research company,   also known as a short-selling company. I'll expalin it to you that why it is called Short Selling  It is same as other companies that run to make a profit. Hindenburg Research makes money through financial research all over the world.  They claim to have 10 years of experience in this field,  but the company was only established in 2017, so it's unclear how they can claim 10 years of experience. may be they are including their indivisual experinces Now, you may be wondering how they make money through Researching. how they work?   If you are familiar with the stock market, you know about short selling. For who don't know, I'll expalin breifly  When you purchase a stock, when the stock price rises then you make a profit .  But there is another way,  where you make a profit when the stock price falls, which is known as short selling.  Here's an example to help explain. let's say I don't have any money  and I get information that the Adani Group's stock will drop on the 10th Suppose each share is worth 3000 rupees I tell my broker to give me an Adani Group share on loan, and I'll return it to him on the 10th but I won't pay the money, I'll give share to the broker at rate of that time. I immediately sell the share I got from the broker in the market at 3000 rupees before 10th Now, let's say on the 10th day, the Adani Group's share drops to 2000 rupees. I buy it back at 2000 rupees and return it to the broker. Now, I have 1000 rupees left over and I made profit. But this will only happen if I know the share price will fall. Keep in mind that this was just an example to help explain the concept.  The game can involve millions or billions of dollars, and the person who lends the share also charges a fee for lending it. This is called Short Selling This is how Hindenburg makes money. Hindenburg Research first does a deep research on a company that is suspected of fraud,   and it takes years to research it. After creating a complete report, they release it on social media and news outlets  As soon as there is a commotion in the market, the shares of that particular company drop,  and Hindenburg makes its money. The company operates by giving all details to its investors before making  the report public. The investors invest money through short selling.  As soon as the company's shares decrease they make a large profit,  and Hindenburg takes a cut of this profit. This is the company's way of making money and they don't carry out any illegal activities   as this is fully legal in the US. Hindenburg Research is a company whose location is not even known. According to Wikipedia, the company has only 5 employees, but still people take it very seriously as they have carried out 45 investigations in the past 5 years, with 75% of their claims proving to be correct. As a result, their investors and partners have benefited in terms of profit. 29 cases have resulted in a 50% or more decrease in the stock of the company they investigated. Before the Adani Group investigation, Hindenburg's biggest investigation was into a company called Nikola, which manufactured electric vehicles Hindenburg named their report on Nikola ""An Ocean of LIes.""  At the time, Nikola's market value was 34 billion dollars,  but after the Hindenburg report was released, its value dropped to only 1.3 billion dollars. It is not always the case that the shares of the company being investigated decreases  and a case against it may also be initiated. After Hindenburg carried out research on Nikola, the US Security & Exchange Commission carried out an enquiry against Nikola and found the director guilty. Several other companies, such as WINS Finance, China Metal Resources Utilization HF Foods, and Blockchain have also been negatively impacted  when Hindenburg published reports on them.  In 90% of cases, shares fall to a great extent and they drop exactly as much as reported by Hindenburg For example, in the Adani case, it is expected that 85% of shares will decrease, this is the reason why rich people around the world fear Hindenburg's reports more than their government. However, in the Adani case Hindenburg Research invested in bonds instead of shares  as all of their investors did not have a license to buy and sell shares in India. after this report bond market is in discussion rather than Share Market People are discussing about share market but, on 1st Februray world's biggest bank  -Credit Swiss Bank give zero rating to Adani Bond which means Credit Swiss have stopped giving loan to their Private Client inexchange of Adani Bonds Traders often take loans by pledging bonds as collateral. through they get money for trading  Previously, loans of 70 to 80 percent of face value could be taken against Adani bonds.  However, Credit Suisse has now considered these bonds as zero,  meaning that no new loans will be given and  those who have taken loans against they will now have to provide additional collateral if they don't to that the bank will liquidate their securities.   Upon receiving this news there was a commotion in the stock market and shares of all companies in the Adani group fell at the same time. Mainstream media isn't covering this This is big drawback for Adani Group On January 25th 2023, Hindenberg released a 106-page report on its website, containing 88 questions asked from the Adani Group, and 720 citations,   meaning the evidence was provided for why it was said.  The title of the report was ""How The World's 3rd Richest Man is Pulling The Largest Con in Corporate History"".  This report was made after two years of research  and multiple travels to different countries where Adani Group links were found Hindenburg Researh  don't even let to know anyone that on whom they are reseaching In the case of Adani, New York magzine published a detailed report in January 2022, on which it was written Nathan Andrewson is dowloding entire Mauritius Corporate Registry but it was unclear at the time who was being researched. It has now been revealed that this was part of an investigation into the Adani Group.   The report was very attacking towards the Adani Group and did not show any leniency.  The report created a storm in India, and as a result, Adani's ranking on the list of the richest people in the world went from the third to the eighth. The company suffered a loss of 65 billion dollars. Lower Cirket had to put on Adani Stock which means you can't exit by selling shares at the particular lowest price   Adani's shares, including Adani Ports, Adani Power and Adani Green, all dropped, causing a loss for Adani and also affecting the Indian stock market, which lost 4 lakh crore rupees. This is very big number many people would found difficult t understand terms of Share Market It's important to have a basic understanding of the stock market, even if you don't invest in it,  as it has an impact on our lives directly or indirectly. its concept are used in every aspect and to understand this you don't have to read books A good audiobook called ""Stock Market Me Nivesh Aur Trading Ke Secrets"" is available on KUKU FM  and can be listened to in any regional language, including Hindi and English, to clear up any concepts. and if you invest too then it will help you there as well There are thousands of different genres of audiobooks available on KUKU FM and you can listen to any of them based on your interests.  I personally use the drive mode when I travel.  You can download from the link in the description and use the coupon code ""NR50"" for a 50% discount on the first month's subscription,  for just Rs 49. lets come back to the topic Regarding the Hindenburg report, it contained multiple allegations against the Adani Group. I will provie link in youtube discription and let me explain you some major allegation  The main allegation is stock manipulation, which has been an ongoing issue for the Adani Group. For example, in March 2020, the price of a share of Adani Enterprise was around 130 rupees,  and by November 2022, the price had risen to over 4,000 rupees.  This is not a normal occurrence for a share price to increase so rapidly. ""What did Adani Enterprise do to cause such a rapid increase in its stock price in such a short amount of time, even during the coronavirus pandemic and when the market is closed due to recession-like conditions? The image shows how Adani group's company has risen high in just three years, as reported in the share."" You may say shares were in demand, that's why Adani's share price increased. Why to panic for this?  It's just a game of demand and supply. But one should also think about why people are buying Adani's shares at such prices? You can say that performance is good, Adani has made so much profit that people are forced to buy shares.  During the time of Corona and recession, their performance was not that great,  so how did their shares increase?  This is because they created an artificial demand. If a company is listed on a Stock Market Exchange, it becomes easy for the company to control demand and supply,  and also control the share prices, which can make the company rich or poor.  That's why SEBI has made a rule that no listed company can hold more than 75% shares, to keep the market fair. Normally, companies keep 40-50% shares with them, but Adani kept 75% of shares with them and for other 25% of shares they create fake demand by investing through their own shell company which is in Mauritius, Singapur and UAE So adani have mojority control indirectly as per Hindenburg Report Apart from this, let me tell you another thing LIC and SBI (where you take insurance from LIC and deposit your money in SBI) have invested in Adani's shares.  LIC has bought Adani's shares for 74 thousand crore rupees,  and SBI has also invested thousands of crores in the Adani group's shares They have also given loans, which is separate, this is just invetment  With all these adani shares demand is increasing and when common man sees this, then he also wanted to make money through Stock Market   So the allegation on Adani Group is that they have increase their share price by creating Artificial demand and not by adani group performance and when government organisation like SBI and LIC invest then this indicate the involvement of Government with Adani Group The share price decide  ""Asia's Ricest"" ""World's Richest"" Company's value increase depending on increasing in share price and owner of company will become more rich Let's say I have a company with a total of 100 shares.  A investor comes and buys 10 shares for 10 thousand. When this happens, my company's valuation becomes 1 lakh. Similarly, when companies like LIC and SBI invest,  the company's valuation increases  and the price of shares goes up And then these shares are used as collateral to take out a loan Adani has taken this loan of 2 Crore and if a 10-12% interest is charged, like it is charged on a common person, then the profit of many companies under Adani Group won't even reach that much. To understand this, there is also a chart of Current Ratio in the Hindenberg report The best way to understand the financial condition of companies  is to find out their Current Ratio. Calculate Current Assets divided by Current Liabilities to find the Current Ratio. If the ratio is less than 1, it means that if the company is asked to return the debt,  it won't have enough assets to sell to pay the debt. According to Hindenburg, the Current Ratio of 5 companies under Adani Group  Adani Green Energy,  Adani Power, Adani Total Gas, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission, and Adani Enterprises  is less than 1. Imagine a scenario where a company has not been able to make a profit or there is a recession. or Adani Total Gas, which has a Current Ratio of 0.2, meaning it has taken 5 times the debt compared to its assets, how will it repay its remaining debt. And when a company takes a loan by giving its shares as collateral,  the loan amount is based on the share price.  For example, if the share is worth a lakh rupees,  then that much loan will be given.  If for some reason the share price decreases  the bank can ask for the loan to be returned. In that case, Adani Group can be in trouble This report tells that Adani Group has taken loan more than needed Look, the report that came out just two days ago shows that LIC has suffered a loss of 18000 crores. This is people's money. In the movie ""Scam 1992,"" Harshad Mehta says   ""If I fall, I won't fall alone, I'll take everyone with me."" So if Adani Group fall then whole GDP will also fall Adani has major contribution in GDP If Adani group fall then whole GDP will also collapse people who invested their money, they will loose it companies like SBI and LIC had invested in Adani Group which is public money If Adani group will fall then these company will also get affected and people will loose their money The Adani Group is such a big thing that  it dismissed the report by Hindenburg.  If it was a small or medium-sized company, it would have completely collapsed Look at the state of the companies that Hindenburg has reported on in the past A 34 billion company came to 1.3 billion. According to Hindenburg, Adani's companies have taken too much loans and, in many cases, have taken loans using shares at inflated prices as collateral.  Many of Adani's listed companies have taken loans greater than their value.  Simply put, Adani's stock prices are artificially inflated due to ""debt-fuelled"" growth,  meaning that they are borrowing money and investing it into their business to make it appear as if the company is growing thereby increasing the share prices. Not only Hindenburg, but even a prestigious research firm, Creditsights, published a report in August 2022 calling the Adani Group ""deeply over-leveraged"".  It warned that the debt could wreak havoc on Adani's entire business empire. Hindenburg also claims that all Adani Group companies are dependent on each other,  so if one company fails to repay its loans  it could seriously affect the others and cause the collapse of the entire Adani Empire About 75% of the shares are held by the Adani group itself while the remaining 25% shares are mostly with Mauritius-based shell companies that are linked to the Adani group and create an artificial demand to increase the shares price. Hindenburg reports have also claimed that Vinod Adani colluded with many others  to set up dummy companies and invested in the Adani group to raise the share price These companies have no corporate presence and only invest in the Adani group. If you saw our video on NDTV then you would know that from the same place investment came All the assest of shell company they have invested in adani group 99.4% of AMPS' 2.3 billion assets are in the Adani Group and Opal's entire investment is in the Adani group. they are not investing else where Acording to Hindenburg, this is the particular way of money rotation in Adani Group SEBI is also investigating this matter, but they have stated that the  investigation has not reached a logical conclusion yet.  In response, Hindenburg has tauntingly said that SEBI has not reached a logical conclusion, but they have.  In response to this, Adani Group replied with a 413 page document, stating that 65 of the 88 questions asked by Hindenberg were already answered in previous public disclosures. The allegation of Investment from the foriegn Adani Group stated that they do not have control over the investment in their public shares  and that they are not aware of who is buying and selling shares This is not just for the Adani Group, but for any listed company, they cannot control who is buying or selling shares. Regarding the loans Adani Group stated that it is a common practice worldwide to take loans by offering shares  and there is a perfect system in place to address this in India.  Hindenberg has no knowledge of India's security laws, which is why they are making such statements. Regarding the SEBI investigation, Adani Group stated that  there is no ongoing investigation against Adani promoters and  any previous investigations have been disclosed. Adani Group also stated that they can file a case against Hindenberg but Hindenberg replied that Adani Group can do so whenever they wish and that it would make it easier for Adani Group to expose them, as they will be able to request the  documents they were unable to obtain during the investigation in court.  Adani Group launched the largest FPO worth INR 20,000 crore in India.  It was divided among 50% retail investors, 28% qualified institutional investors and 22% non-institutional investors.  Although the FPO was fully subscribed, retail investors showed little confidence with only 5.4% of them subscribing The majority of the subscriptions came from non-institutional investors at 62%  and qualified institutional investors at 32%. The FPO did not pick up in the first two days, but was saved by the investment of Abu Dhabi's International Holding Company (IHC), which invested INR 3200 crore. IHC is not just a company owned by UAE business people but has a significant share of the UAE royal family. Adani faced rejection from retail investor but Adani Group tried to fully subscribe the FPO to institutional investors but due to the current share price being lower than the FPO price no new investor was willing to pay the premium. with so much effort also Adani have to take back their FPO There are questions about the timing of the report as it was released 48 hours before the largest FPO in India.  It is believed that this report was released to target India's economy as a part of a plan. Short selling companies, who benefit from such events, were behind the publication of this report, and Hindenburg Research did this to make more money.  This has been seen before where global organizations target a country before a big event like how all the issues in Qatar were exposed before FIFA.  In September, there will be a G20 summit in India,  and you will see India being targeted in different ways before that. You may consider this report as attack on Adani or India. I leave it to you The allegations against Adani in this report by Hindenburg Research are not new they have been made repeatedly in the past and this report is a compilation of all the allegations against Adani Group. At last let me remind you that I have provided link of Kuku FM's Audio book ""Stock Market main Nivesh or trading ke Secret"" Downloand and listen to this for more clarty Thank You

37,Misleading,"a good Rift requires people to believe four 
things people need to believe it's credible  

people need to believe it will give them wealth 
or a better life people need to believe it will  

be easy and people need to believe that the 
grifter has a secret to making it all work AI  

is going to be a better opportunity for scammers 
than cryptocurrency and it's already starting but  

I'm going to be going for exactly how you can use 
this new AI book with chat GPT to help you when  

it comes to making money online in this video I'm 
going to show you a stupid easy way to make money  

with chat GPT I don't need to tell you about chat 
GPT if you have been anywhere on the internet in  

the last six months you already know about what 
it and other programs like it can do designing  

images writing code and creating content are the 
most time consuming tasks in the most typed up  

Industries Tech and online marketing if you pay 
attention to the space you will hear about people  

making enormous fortunes on a daily basis the 
challenge is that coding writing and creating  

digital media takes a lot of effort and requires 
talent and experience someone who needs to quick  

money now doesn't have time to learn about web 
development or take a Photoshop course and AI  

is the answer to that new programs can take basic 
prompts and create viable content which can then  

be monetized except it just doesn't work and 
idiots on the internet need to stop telling you  

it does new AI programs are not going to make 
you rich and there are four reasons why that  

happens to line up perfectly with the ingredients 
that make a great grift the first reason is that  

the fields they apparently work in only reward 
top performers and AI doesn't produce content  

as good as the best humans the most frequently 
recommended AI hustle is creating fully automated  

YouTube channels the business plan is to get 
chat GPT to write you a video mid-journey to  

create a slideshow of visuals and some freemium 
online software to turn it into a video to post  

on YouTube and make that sweet ad Revenue to 
qualify for monetization on YouTube a channel  

needs a minimum of 4 000 hours of watch time and 
1 000 subscribers that doesn't sound like much but  

less than one percent of channels ever qualify 
for the partner program and this barrier was  

so challenging for new channels to overcome the 
YouTube lowered the requirement to 3 000 hours  

of watch time and 500 subscribers even if the 
channels that gain enough of a following to be  

monetized most are only making a few dollars a day 
it took me and most of the other creators I speak  

with personally more than a year of making content 
before we were monetized making videos is time  

consuming so letting AI do all of the work for you 
plays well into one of the key ingredients of a  

good grift people need to believe it will be easy 
the trouble is that AI is just not very good yet  

and the reason you don't see many other channels 
run by robots is not because people aren't trying  

it's because a YouTube algorithm simply isn't 
making them as visible because there are better  

videos made by real creators still putting in 
effort you may not like the weird energy of Mr  

Beast or the poll Brothers but they are much more 
engaging than an internet word generator so they  

get millions of views and the millions of people 
trying to create automated channels get nothing  

Drop Shipping is another common grip that has 
the same apparent Advantage which is really its  

biggest weakness if you are one of the lucky few 
that has not had the Drop Shipping dream pitch  

to you yet the business plan is to find overseas 
companies selling cheap products overseas using  

websites like Alibaba once you find something you 
think will sell well you set up a website of your  

own to sell those products at a higher price when 
someone buys something off your website you turn  

around and buy it off the overseas seller and 
simply give them the address of the purchaser  

so they can handle the postage and you keep the 
profit but not only will you be competing with  

the thousands of other people that are trying to 
do the same thing you will also be competing with  

Walmart and Amazon that offer faster delivery 
times better brand recognition lower prices a  

wider product selection and have millions of 
visitors visiting their stores all the time  

people selling Drop Shipping courses also rarely

Alibaba themselves and buy the product at the 
lower price creating content using AI runs into  

all of the same problems it's pitched as an easy 
way to build a business or generate side income

the second reason that AI has already 
become such a great grift is that the  

ways that it can make you money sound 
credible Chad gbt only mixes together  

stuff it scraped off the internet but it 
can still do some pretty impressive stuff  

and we're gonna get some answers is it magic is it 
just algorithms is it going to save us or destroy  

us let's go find out another popular plan to make 
money using AI has been letting chat GPT pick  

stocks for you all the big Financial influencers 
have made some variation of this video and even  

reputable Outlets like CNN business have written 
an articles suggesting that AI chatbots can pick  

stocks for you better than a fund manager I hope 
to most of you that sounds totally ridiculous  

because it is but it's also easy to understand why 
people would fall for this financial education is  

severely lacking in America in most other 
countries people are told that they should  

invest and it's normally left at that accessing 
a paid Financial professional is expensive and  

makes a mere active investing pointless if you 
have to pay someone two thousand dollars to tell  

you how to invest your remaining eight thousand 
dollars so the only option is turning to people  

on the internet that give general advice that 
won't be suitable for everyone or in some cases  

from that's why I'm really proud to stand behind 
today's sponsor FTX another thing that people know  

is important but don't know much about is AI 
speaking with just a little bit of authority  

about these two topics will attract a big audience 
there are computer Pro programs employed by Major  

Quant funds that are coded by people with phds 
and statistics physics and computer science these  

are programs that use millions of data points to 
gain a slight Edge in trading this makes the claim  

about AI investing sound credible since chat GPT 
is an impressive computer program that uses a huge  

data set it's been able to do things like pass the 
bar exam on its first try so it should be able to  

do the same thing as those Quant algorithms right 
wrong the programs that Quant funds use only work  

when they exclusively execute a strategy and 
they often don't work and when they do they  

only work for a short time before the market 
reverse Engineers what they are doing and does  

the same thing that's very different from passing 
the bar which is mostly a test of memorizing legal  

precedence since chant GPT has a large Bank of 
training data it gives it an unfair Advantage an  

average person with some basic legal training 
could probably pass the bar too if they were  

allowed to bring a laptop with an archive of case 
law into the exam room but they are not investing  

is very different from passing the bar any 
strategy that can be accessed by typing a prompt  

into chat gbt T is going to have zero Competitive 
Edge over the market because anybody else can do  

the same thing also Chan gbt does not take your 
personal financial situation into account and  

since its training data only goes up to 2021 it's 
out of date too the reason the better Financial  

creators on YouTube don't talk about what to 
invest in is because they know it's impossible  

to give good advice to such a large audience this 
is frustrating for them because they can see how  

much money other people are making by claiming 
to be Financial experts and giving advice that  

is really hurting people so don't ever expect meet 
Kevin to sell you a Stock Investing course thank  

you so much for considering this course you are 
fake news it's also frustrating to Their audience  

because people like Patrick Boyle the plain bagel 
and Ben Felix are Financial professionals with  

qualifications licenses and certifications 
that make them much better equipped to give  

advice but it's because of their experience that 
they know that they can't give advice a simple  

recommendation like you should buy a broad market 
index fund is good advice for some people but it  

can be terrible advice for people with short term 
financial goals high interest debt or no emergency  

savings since as YouTubers we can't control who 
watches our videos the next best thing we can  

do is not give any advice at all Chad GPT has 
the same limitations it doesn't understand your  

finances it just predicts what word makes the 
most sense to type out next so even if it does  

look like you can make everything easier please 
don't use it for financial advice the AI hype is  

made to sound even more credible because there 
are people that are going to get rich off this  

technology the fear of missing out on an exciting 
Trend like this can make it hard to stay sensible  

the people that are going to make millions in 
this industry fall into three categories the first  

group are the people that can actually create 
programs like chatgpt because they are geniuses  

in the fields of machine learning allowing them 
to start their own companies or negotiate huge  

salary packages from Big tech companies that 
want top talent in the space the next group are  

people who have already invested into AI companies 
that are now benefiting off investor hype and the  

third group are people that run regular businesses 
that can use AI to make operations more efficient  

which is different from building a business 
completely from scratch using AI if you're not  

in one of these groups that's okay nobody can be 
in the right place at the right time every time  

and chasing Trends is a costly exercise the third 
reason that AI is going to make such a great grift  

is because it's easy for people to claim they have 
the secret to making it all work AI programs are  

easy to use but they still have a learning curve 
and to utilize them to their fullest potential  

you are going to need to look up Guides Online 
to learn how to get it to work and what can be  

done with it that's an easy way for people to 
make big claims and soak up those sweet clicks  

they might claim it's harmless but it isn't and 
that's because one of the biggest problems in the  

YouTuber Finance space is a strategy I call the 
bait and backpedal this is where a YouTuber will  

post a clickbait title like how to use chat GPT to 
become a millionaire and then say nothing in the  

video about how this program is supposed to make 
you a millionaire the people that have perfected  

this strategy will even cover themselves in the 
video by saying that people shouldn't risk their  

money and that AI is not made for this which is 
the back pedal part of the strategy that means if  

they are ever called out they can just claimed 
that the person didn't watch their video but  

by that point the damage is done not every person 
that sees a thumbnail will click on it I am pretty  

bad at clickbait so my numbers may be worse but 
for every one view on my channel my video needs  

to be displayed to 15 people on average a lot 
of people will just see that chat GPT can make  

them a millionaire and never watch the video that 
says precisely the opposite and that's the fourth  

reason it's easy to believe that this could change 
your life starting a business or investing is  

not exciting if it's exciting you are probably 
doing something wrong investing is a long-term  

and boring exercise that rewards discipline more 
than chasing Trends starting business is the same  

with the addition of a lot of hard work an easy 
shortcut sounds great but the best examples of  

this not working is actually the second richest 
family in America they run their business in such  

a traditional way that their Executives still 
need to sign in with a punch card not chasing  

trends like AI is exactly how they have stayed 
wealthy but to find out the hidden Brilliance  

behind doing things the old way go and watch my 
video about how a broke candy maker but the fourth  

largest private company in America and if you want 
to get these videos a day earlier than everyone  

else sign up to my newsletter compounded 
daily to keep on learning how money works

38,Misleading,"Hey everyone. This is KeriTV. If you haven't seen this channel before, this is all the ins, outs, ups, downs, latest trends, hottest deals for buying, selling, and investing in real estate in Los Angeles. Every week we bring new information and the inside track to get you the best deals and the most for your home and the best investments in Los Angeles. So subscribe below and stay tuned. The headlines are absolutely killing us lately, amongst other things. It is an interesting time to be in this world. We are all doing the best we can, making sense of everything coming at us. And unfortunately, a lot of the headlines that they're putting out there are not completely, not that they're not the facts, but they're misleading. Now of course, the news is so important, but the news agenda in 2020 is really selling something, whether it's their political side or an advertisement, or just the fact that you're tuning in or reading. So they're loving what's going on in the world. And the more negativity that they can bring to you, the more likely you're going to click on it. Now, the real facts of what's going on in the market per se, or how this data is being interpreted is not really forthcoming, or you really have to go the next step to understand it. And we're all busy people. So a lot of times we see the headline and we move on. The showings themselves, which I've talked about every week have been going up, have been increasing since the pandemic started. We had a big decline, which I've discussed, but since then they have been going up and up dramatically every week. We are now right now, up 21% nationally on showings. So you can see here, this graph, what the levels were like in January, the big dip in March and April, and how they have skyrocketed up to 21% nationally right now. Now they're saying that 87% of sellers are scared to sell their homes because of the pandemic, which absolutely, if you don't want strangers in your home, you don't have to happen. But the majority of sellers out there think that no houses are selling, when in fact 372,000 homes sold last month in America. For the 10th street week, we have seen mortgage applications rise, which we'll show you a slide here. That means that people are either seeing houses and applying for mortgages or applying for mortgages and are about to see houses. You've got all these people from the spring market that haven't bought yet, or a big chunk of them because sales declined about 40%. So now those people along with the summer buyer are trying to get into homes, which leads me to my point about some of the multiple offers we're experiencing. So this past week has been probably the craziest week of my entire career. We wrote on a house in Santa Monica for 2.1 million that had eight offers on it. We wrote on a house in West LA for 1.6 million that had 34 offers on it. And I mentioned that on my Instagram story and two agents I know also wrote on that property, 34 offers. We also wrote on another house in Hancock Park for 1.6 that had 24 offers and they were going about 1.9 at that point. In addition to the showings, the mortgages, the myths that are out there is also the housing market recovery index. We are at a baseline of 100, we're at 101. So that shows you that from January, February, we are almost right exactly where the housing market recovery index would be leading to higher prices than pre-pandemic. So we're seeing really interesting things happening. New listings are down 20% year over year. So way more demand, mortgage applications are increasing, rates are extremely low and you have less properties to sell. And one of the last things about headlines I wanted to discuss was the unemployment rates. The headline was 51 million people have filed for unemployment. Holy cow, that is a scary number. And that's hard to stomach. The reality is only 16.2 are currently unemployed. Not that that's a low number. Not that that's not important. It's extremely important. And it's very sad to hear. What's important is looking at the relation of 51 million that have applied, versus 16.2 that are currently unemployed. Those are the stats and the data that we need to look at when it comes to our finances and our housing, and what's going on in our financial world. Now, another fact which is broken down, which is still very sad is that 65% of the people that are unemployed right now, 65% are under 25. So you have a large amount of unemployed workforce that aren't in the housing sector buying right now, whether they're still living with their parents or renting, this isn't the group of people that we see buying. Oh, I'm getting calls from buyers, they're talking about lowballing or trying to get a good deal right now and it's just not happening. I don't know what exactly will happen in a year or two from now, but right now we are seeing pretty consistent numbers that prices are rising and they're about 7% over last year. They're said to keep going up from all the major resources. So my job is informing you, I like to do it with a smile, but there's a lot of things happening in the world. But as far as the housing sector goes, if you are looking to move up, we've got strategies for that, have no fear. And if you're a first time buyer, we can give you all the tools and tricks and things that we do to help. So that is the story today, this week. Thank you for tuning in. And if you have any questions about this, I'm always here. Cheers guys.

39,Misleading,"TikTok has been extensively adopted as an alternative to Google searches based on videos. However, some influencers have been found to spread unverified misinformation about crypto investments on social media platforms, often attempting to persuade unwary viewers to invest their (or their parents) hard-earned money in loss-making cryptocurrencies.


TikTok influencers use the hashtag ‘#cryptok’ when publishing crypto-related content. dappGambl’s analysis of more than 1,161 crypto-related TikTok videos revealed that more than one-third of them were misleading. The research also revealed that only one out of every ten cryptok accounts or videos included a disclaimer warning users about the risk of investments.

The research findings have raised concerns about the potential hazards that investors face when using social media platforms such as TikTok. Experts have cautioned investors to exercise prudence when making investment decisions and to consult with qualified financial advisors.

The study serves as a timely reminder that investors must be vigilant when investing in crypto and should not rely solely on social media platforms for information. Before making investment decisions, they should seek advice from qualified professionals and do their own research.

Details of the research findings
47% of the platforms creators were discovered attempting to push services in order to make money. Mainstream influencers such as Kim Kardashian, Jake Paul, and Soulja Boy have already been accused of promoting cryptocurrencies to their millions of fans while failing to disclose money received.

According to the study, one out of every three deceptive videos on the platform mentions Bitcoin. Furthermore, videos on TikTok with popular crypto-related hashtags like crypto, cryptok, cryptoadvice, cryptocurrency, cryptotrading, and cryptoinvesting have received over 6 billion views.

Viewers frequently overlook their favorite influencers’ bad intentions and end up accepting their content solely based on the number of views or likes. Before making any type of investment, both novice and experienced investors should conduct extensive research on crypto ventures.

According to the survey, the deceptive content creators studied had a combined following of more than 35 million, with an average following of 145K. Because Tiktok prioritizes popular material over fact-checked content, even people who do not follow the accounts can see these videos through the for you tab or by searching the hashtags.

Scams perpetrated by crypto influencers and crypto celebrities are on the rise. On April 2, a $1 billion lawsuit for promoting unregistered securities was lodged against crypto exchange Binance, its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, and three crypto influencers.

Kim Kardashian was fined $1.26 million by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for her promotion of EthereumMax (EMAX). Despite the fact that TikTok influencers have a smaller reach than their mainstream counterparts, the financial risk for unwary investors remains high.

FAQs on using TikTok for investment
1. Can you rely on TikTok for investment advice?
Although the platform can be a great place to learn, it is essential to keep in mind that cryptocurrencies are unregulated, and misinformation can spread quickly. Always do your own research before relying on the platform’s recommendations.

2. How can you spot a scam on TikTok?
TikTok is designed to recommend videos to users who are interested in them. If a user is interested in crypto content, the For You page is likely to display crypto-related videos. However, it is essential to consider that no one can guarantee returns. If something seems too wonderful to be true, it probably is.

3. What should you look out for while watching TikTok crypto videos?
The fact that a video has tens of thousands of likes and views does not make the content authentic and reliable. If a creator is promoting his or her own advice or services, he or she likely has an ulterior motive to produce viral content. Extra caution should be exercised when accessing paid services.

4. Why is crypto content so popular on TikTok?
There are several explanations why cryptocurrency and investment-related content is so popular on TikTok. The platform’s predominantly youthful user base is becoming increasingly interested in their personal finances and future financial planning. "
40,Misleading,"I've had several recent conversations on this sub that inspired me to do some analysis. This is the result.

TL;DR: The last bear market lasted for 17 months, during which total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell by ~76% from its all-time high. If you'd invested $400 in BTC and $400 in the bottom 20 alt-coins (by market cap), then as of today's date, your investments would be worth ~$11,564 (BTC) and ~$18,740 (alts)--a total of ~$30,304--despite the fact that 16 out of the bottom 20 alts disappeared in the intervening years. I believe the lesson here is to spread your alt-coin investments out.

What Happened in the Last Bear Market?

This section was inspired by /u/MisterKyles 's post.

According to CoinMarketCap, during the earlier bull market, total crypto market capitalization peaked on November 30, 2013, at ~$15.2 billion. Thereafter, a long bear market began, during which total market cap bobbed up and down for over a year, hitting its first major low of ~$3.6 billion on January 16, 2015--a ~75% drop--and then going back up to as high as ~$4.7 billion in mid-March. Finally, on April 26, 2015, the market hit bottom at ~$3.5 billion--a ~76% drop.

This year, total crypto market cap hit an all-time high of ~$828 billion on January 7, 2018. If the current bear market were to exactly mirror the 2013-2015 bear market (and it won't, but this is still a good jumping-off point), then we would expect to see the market hit a low of ~$196 billion by mid-June 2019.

As I write this, we're currently at ~$260 billion (i.e., down ~68.5% from ATH), having hit a low of ~$248 billion in the past few weeks (i.e., down ~70% from ATH). This suggests that we may still have a significant distance to go--both in terms of time (i.e., another ~14 months) and market cap lost (i.e., ~25% of the current market cap)--before we see the bottom of the current market. I'm personally somewhat more bullish than that, as I think any correction will be over by the end of Q3 2018, but that's what would happen if this crash were to exactly mirror the last one.

What if You Invested Money Shortly After the Market Hit Bottom?

This next section was inspired by a comment by /u/SlinkiesAreSpies , who wrote,

99% of alt coins die

We then proceeded to have a vigorous debate about it, during which I was referred to this market snapshot
, from May 3, 2015--i.e., exactly one week after the market hit bottom in 2015.

Of the top 20 coins by market capitalization, 17 are still around--that is, only three coins, or 15%, died.

Of the bottom 20 coins (i.e., the coins ranked 522-542 on that day), 4 are still around--that is, of the worst coins from this arbitrary date, 80% are gone. That's absolutely terrible, but it's nowhere near 99%.

So, let's look at the prices of the four survivors from the bottom 20:

Tigercoin (TGC; current rank: 1075): Up from $0.000125 to $0.005188--a 41x gain. Worth noting, however, that the trading volume was only $46 in the past 24 hours.

Dotcoin (DOT; current rank: 542): Up from $0.000034 to $0.018939--a 557x gain. Volume was not terrible, at ~$24k in the past 24 hours.

TrickyCoin (TRICK; current rank: 1555, apparently due to lack of data): Up from $0.000029 to $0.006463--a 222x gain. Worth noting that CoinMarketCap has very little info on this coin right now. As an aside, I'll also add that the coin's name doesn't exactly inspire confidence...

Coin(0) (CNO; current rank: 1061): Up from $0.000021 to $0.002807--a 133x gain. Worth noting, however, that volume was only $4 in the past 24 hours.

So, would I buy any of the above coins today? Probably not. That said, however, let's imagine the following experiment:

Put $400 in BTC on May 3, 2015. BTC has increased 28.9x since then, so you'd have $11,564 as of today's date.

Put $20 in each of the bottom 20 coins on May 3, 2015. In this experiment, 16 of the coins that you purchased die, so you lose $320. However, the remaining $80, which is spread across the four coins that survived is worth $19,060. This means that your net profit is $18,740, which is $7,176, or 62% more than you would have made if you'd invested in Bitcoin.

Finally, even assuming that you decide to count TGC, TRICK, and CNO as ""dead"" due to lack of trading volume/information, you've still made $11,140 from DOT alone--which is almost on-par with BTC.

I think the lessons here are (1) although a majority of low-ranked alt-coins die, it's nowhere near 99%; and (2) you should probably spread alt-coin investments out.

I'm also considering running this as an experiment with the current 522-542-ranked coins, but I probably don't have the cash right now. Feedback on this post is very much appreciated!"

The SEC likewise found numerous compliance failures, including misleading disclosures about custody of clients’ cryptocurrency assets and the use of improper “hedge clauses” in client agreements. In addition, Titan Worldwide violated the marketing rule by advertising hypothetical performance metrics without taking the required steps. Titan Worldwide has cooperated with the investigation and agreed to a cease-and-desist order, a disgorgement fee of $192,454, and a civil penalty of $850,000, which will be distributed to influenced clients.

Numerous compliance failures and improper use of hedge clauses
Violation of marketing rule by advertising hypothetical performance metrics without taking required steps
Titan Worldwide cooperated with the investigation and agreed to a cease-and-desist order, disgorgement fee, and civil penalty
SEC’s decision serves as a warning for all advisers to secure compliance

The SEC’s action against Titan Worldwide outlines the importance of transparency and compliance in the cryptocurrency industry. Investment advisers must provide accurate and complete information to investors, and any misleading or improper practices won’t be be tolerated. This serves as a reminder for all advisers to carefully review their disclosures and marketing materials to secure they are in compliance with regulations.


The SEC Discovered That Titan Crypto Investment Firm Failed To Establish Suitable Employee Trading Practices

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged Titan Global Capital Management, a fintech investment manager, in a series of allegations relating to advertising and compliance violations.
The SEC said that the New York-based company's website contained false statements about ""hypothetical performance,"" in violation of the SEC's revised marketing rule, which took effect from December 2020.

Based on three weeks of data since its August 2021 launch, Titan had claimed that its Titan Crypto product would return up to 2,700% annualized. The SEC discovered that the company failed to establish suitable employee trading practices prior to October 2022 and made ambiguous claims concerning the custody of cryptocurrency assets and other policies.

Titan Global Capital Management, a company registered with the SEC and a participant in the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, has accepted a cease-and-desist order, a censure and fines. Titan has self-reported some of the problems and assisted the inquiry.

Without acknowledging or rejecting the findings, they consented to the SEC order. The SEC's actions included a $850,000 penalty that would be given to the harmed clients and a disgorgement of ill-gotten gains of $192,454 with interest.

Senior SEC enforcement officer Osman Nawaz stressed that the action should serve as a reminder to all advisers to ensure compliance."
42,Misleading,"Fintech investment adviser Titan Global Capital Management has agreed to a cease-and-desist order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), along with censure and penalties after the agency pressed charges related to advertising and compliance failures.

According to the SEC, the New York-based firm made misleading claims on its website that were based on “hypothetical performance” in violation of the SEC’s amended marketing rule of December 2020. This was the first case of charges made under that rule. SEC senior enforcement officer Osman Nawaz said in a statement:

“The Commission amended the marketing rule to allow for the use of hypothetical performance metrics but only if advisers comply with requirements reasonably designed to prevent fraud. […] This action serves as a warning for all advisers to ensure compliance.”

Titan claimed “annualized” performance based on three weeks of data could lead to returns of up to 2,700% on its Titan Crypto product, which debuted in August 2021. The SEC found that the firm also made unclear statements about crypto asset custody and other policies and failed to adopt appropriate policies on employee trading in the period leading up to October 2022.

Titan is registered by the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The firm self-reported some of the issues and cooperated with the investigation before agreeing to the SEC order, without admitting or denying the SEC findings. The SEC action also included $192,454 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with interest and a fine of $850,000 that will be distributed to affected customers.


The SEC has made tightened enforcement for crypto investment advisers a regulatory goal. It announced the new focus in a February statement from the Division of Examinations. It has also proposed changes to custody rules that could negatively impact cryptocurrency firms.

Titan said in a statement, “We fully cooperated with the SEC’s inquiry and are pleased to have reached a resolution of these issues. The SEC Order acknowledges Titan’s cooperation and remedial efforts since July 2022, including hiring a new Chief Legal and Chief Compliance Officer and additional legal and compliance staff. Titan continues to make significant investments to build and enhance its compliance program.”

43,Misleading,"You all might be knowing Kim Kardashian

She is a well-known influencer in the USA and a billionaire

Recently, SEC imposed a penalty of 1.3 billion on her

which is the market regulator of the USA

The penalty was charged because she had promoted a brand of  cryptocurrency

and she didn't disclose that she got charged for that brand promotion

These kinds of incidents not only happened in the USA but also happened in India

Before, a cryptocurrency brand got bankrupt

Some influencers promoted it

Now here the question arises

Are there any laws  against this in India?

Because I don't remember any influencer

being charged with such a huge penalty in India till now

So in this video, we are going to learn that

Are there any laws or guidelines regarding sponsorships on social media?

And especially if we'll talk about the finance domain

then there are some guidelines or rules of SEBI

Which are broken by some influencers

Aren't there rules in some cases and only gray areas where influencers operate?

We're going to talk in detail about it in this video.

The video will be interesting and very informative for the current generation.

So keep watching!

If we want to identify a problem properly,

then firstly we have to understand the whole ecosystem

How does the Social Media Ecosystem Operate?

From where money is generated?

Where does it go?

How does it split?

Look, there are three main stakeholders

The first one is the online social media platform

For eg., YouTube, where content is uploaded

Secondly, we've creators, who create the content, work hard and upload it

The third one is our audience i.e.  , consumers

who consumes the content

Talking about myself, I am both a consumer and a creator

What is the Revenue Source here?

On YouTube or any other social media platform, a huge audience is watching the content

So many brands get interested to run their ADs on these platforms

AD directly runs on YouTube

and the revenue thus generated gets split between YouTube and the content creator

As YouTube ADs are  concerned, the expectations of all the parties are clear

Expectations of YouTube are clear

that we've given you a platform and distribution channel

Therefore we'll keep a part of the revenue On

the other hand expectations of content creators are clear

Since he is creating  the content so he should be paid for it

Expectations of the audience are also probably clear

that if we're getting so much quality content for free

then we can watch the ADs

Another source of revenue for content creators is sponsorship

i.e., brand integrations

If a  creator promotes a brand in his content

then the brand pays some money to the creator

Here some problem is created and we'll talk about it in detail

The third source of income for content creators is their products or services

Here also generally people don't  have any problem

If a creator is providing the services and investing his time then he has to be paid

so here also expectations are clear Apart

from this, products are another source

The creator can sell merchandise, T-shirt, mugs or toys, or anything  else Or

if a tech company is having its channel

There are many big tech companies and nowadays everyone wants to join social media

They talk about their products and here also expectations are clear

and under product and services, there is one more product called Digital Courses

Many  controversies happened concerning to this

So we'll talk in detail about Digital Courses and Sponsorship

Firstly, let's talk about Sponsorship

First, we've to understand, a creator has to manage a team if he is creating the content

If he's hiring such a big  team

then he has to spend to create quality content

Maybe he's not getting sufficient revenue from YouTube ADs There

are many creators in entertainment or other types who receive huge revenue from YouTube ADs

But many creators find it very difficult to support themselves only on YouTube ADs

They  take sponsorships in such cases

What are the laws and guidelines here?

YouTube gives the guideline that whenever you create sponsored content, you've to mark it 'sponsored'

This is a YouTube feature

So if you realize that an AD is sponsored but it's not marked as sponsored

Then you can tell that YouTuber in the comment section

Along with it, there are clear guidelines of ASCI also

If any creator is receiving the monetary benefit in any form by creating a video

through a brand

Then he needs to mention that this content is sponsored

So this was about the disclaimer of sponsorship

But complexity increases  when we talk about Finfluencer

when financial advice comes or when we talk about a financial product

For eg., an entertainer sponsored a product worth Rs 100 or 200

and by chance that product wasn't good, then also the audience won't suffer a  big loss

But if financial advice turned wrong and someone puts his life savings then he can suffer a huge loss

Because of this regulator comes into the picture

In the case of India, the financial regulator of India is SEBI

come under SEBI

For eg., in the case of cryptocurrency,

Presently, cryptocurrencies don't fall under any regulation

So, no penalty is charged till now against any influencer

But many regulations are being developed for influencers in different countries

In Australia and China,  regulations have been proposed

According to the regulations, you can't give any financial product advice without getting a license from the regulator

In India, many influencers are openly recommending stocks and Mutual Funds without taking a license

This is absolutely illegal

Many times you see thumbnails  like '2 Stocks to Buy or

Best Stock to Buy This Month

or best stock to Buy and Forget

This is clearly Misleading

You should either have a SEBI Registered Research Analyst license or a SEBI Registered Investment advisor license

Then only you can give stock or Mutual Fund  recommendations

There are many channels on Telegram, YouTube, Instagram, and WhatsApp where people are giving recommendations openly

And this is totally illegal

If you see any such recommendation then clearly tell this to that influencer or creator

Many influencers operate in gray areas too

They don'  t say that I am recommending this stock, instead, they say I am investing in this stock

I am not asking you to invest in this stock

I am just saying that I am investing in this stock

But attractive thumbnails like 'Best Stocks to Buy &  Forget' are visible here too

So if you've written something like this in the thumbnail,

then that too comes under misleading

Many people write, #RiskFreeReturns or #RiskFreetradingStrategies

#RiskFreeInvestingStrategies

Firstly, no investment or trading strategy is risk free

isn't risk-free

So if you create thumbnails like this, then these are also misleading









of Australia would be imposed on influencers in India,

Then a lot of content would be filtered out

People would probably stop uploading misleading content

and providing financial product advice without a license

I am sure SEBI would be thinking about some proceedings against this

and I think some  regulation would be proposed regarding this

THE KEN did a detailed story based on sponsorships and Finfluencers

Which is a new paid service

I will provide the link in the description, but since it's a paid service, you would have to pay

and it's not sponsored content,  I am just telling you for reference

And through this video, we're not willing to make someone learn something

we're not trying to guide any influencer

too

Their decision is their own

whatever they'  ll decide for their channel

I can talk about my channel

that is how we do due diligence

However, we took sponsorships in past but we rarely make sponsored content

almost negligible

But whenever we took sponsorship, we tried to do high-level due diligence

Firstly we  never recommended a stock, mutual fund, or any cryptocurrency

We have given recommendations regarding investment platforms only

Where you can invest or trade in all types of financial products

and whenever we give a recommendation, we try to keep our due diligence process in depth

we study  that product in brief, use it and if we find that product or team really good then only we recommend it And

through this video, I don't want to say that we did everything right

we also did mistakes in

past  ., when we took a sponsorship,

I forgot to mark sponsored in a video content

and as soon as told the audience that you did sponsor content without mentioning it

Immediately we rectified it and marked it sponsored

and we told them in comments that we'd  forgotten and we've rectified it

So as an audience we must know which one is sponsored content and which is not

Secondly, when financial advice is concerned, you should ask them

Do you have a license from SEBI to recommend this?

If you find any misleading content, definitely inform them in the comment section

According to me, this message must reach the creators

And after feedback also, if a creator repeats the mistakes again and again

Then I think credibility and trust are very important

Which creator is  more trustworthy and which is less

Who you would like to follow

So this was all about sponsorships

Another big controversial topic is Digital Courses

Addressing it is important according to me

Many people say that the whole information is available on YouTube

You need not to buy any course

Definitely, that argument is right in some way

But nowadays we lack of time

We want a structured course

Many times we even don't know what we've to search

So it's good if we're getting a course in a structured form

If it  can give us value add

If we could learn something from that while saving our time and efforts

then what's bad?

Another thing is, Is it worth the money?

Is it worth the amount we're paying for it?

you've to decide that

Many controversies arise here too

Many people say that people are selling courses worth Rs 50 thousand or 1 lakh but they are not worth it

But assume that after doing a course, if someone's income doubles

Then for him, the 50  thousand Rs course was also worth it

What is the right value of a course?

How can we decide?

If a 500 Rs course is good or a course of 10 thousand Rs or a course of 50 thousand Rs

You all tell me in the comment section, what should be the price of a course?

This can be a big debate

So according to me the price of the course is not important

The important thing is, how much beneficial, the course would be

What will be my return on investment?

How much my skills would enhance?

How much my income can increase?

Secondly, the market corrects them by themselves

and if someone is selling an expensive course

then definitely it's a big opportunity







've seen this in the case of IIT-JEE and medical coaching

Many new players came and drastically decreased the fees

Market eventually disrupted

But when we think of buying a course as a consumer or audience

then the important thing is, choosing the right course

First  of all, we should know about the content of that course

whether it is providing a table of contents

How much your skills would enhance by that content

How much income you could generate after doing the course

Secondly, who is providing that course?

What is the profile of the content creator?

Is he a practicing professional or just talking casually

as a random guy

who would have probably copy pasted things from the internet

Or it could be a trustworthy brand providing course content

Where you can give your feedback if any

And they try to improvise

So you should know  who is providing the course content which you're consuming

Third, Identify Misselling and Misrepresentation

Courses adds some values

But many people don't talk about the course content

or they don't talk about the value add from that course

In some way they are selling  you a lifestyle

You could see a fancy car or home behind them

They would tell that before they didn't have a good lifestyle

and after that, I got to know some good things which improved my lifestyle

But they are not exactly talking about what you  are going to learn

so it can be a big red flag

4th.  Is it really worth the money?

Are we really getting returns from whatever we paid?

What value add are we getting?

Do a cost-benefit analysis

So we've talked about courses too i.e., the second part of the video

Apart from this, there is third another controversial video

About which we haven't talked much

Which is Predatory Content Creators

predatory content creators?

many people create negative content

like exposing a popular content creator

or being judgmental of another content creator

They want to ride on the popularity of some other person

So here the question arises

Is it wrong to criticize someone?

No, there is nothing wrong with it

You can criticize

But we should visit the channel of that creator and check his whole content

Does he always expose or criticize people?

Or he says positive things too

According to me, this is also important

And whoever creator he is criticizing

We should visit his channel and check if he really deserves so much criticism or not or that creator did some value add also

I would quote an example too

I was watching one video by a creator and I found that most of the videos on the creator's channel were critical

and he was criticizing

that nowadays people make online courses and defraud you

and in the same video, they were selling another course

So how can we  decide

Which course is right

Which skills are more important?

Is one skill more important and the other less?

So I think there is no need to follow someone blindly

Especially negative content gains more popularity

So if you are watching such content then visit the creator's channel

and please do visit the channel of the creator being criticized

Now 4th important point is the comment section

Often,  people write just abusive things in the comment section

And if you are writing such abusive things,

then give a logical argument with it

Even if you are criticizing us too

then we would be happy to read it as feedback if you would give an argument with it

Even we want to improve

So these were four important points

Which are very relevant in the case of influencers or influencer marketing

However, I don't like the word 'Influencer'

I would rather prefer calling myself a creator

Because in some way, negative connotation  comes from influencers

That we're trying to influence someone's decision

We rather prefer to empower people to take decisions by themselves

If we'll provide someone right amount of research and knowledge

then everyone is capable of deciding by themselves

and in conclusion, this video isn  't meant to target someone

But presently, whatever problems I came across with that ecosystem

Where I think some positivity needs to be created

That's why this video was important

44,Misleading,"We're running a competition to find the

most misleading advertisements for UK

investors. Use our guide to calibrate

your Scam Detector and once you've found an

advertisement which you think is very

misleading email it to us and we'll

enter it in the competition. Happy

hunting and here's our guide. Let's start

off by exploring the relationship

between risk and return. If you take a

low risk you should expect a low return.

If you take a high risk there's a

potential of getting a high return but

there's also a risk of taking a very

large loss. In concrete terms the low

risk option is to put your money into a

bank account. As bank cash interest

rates are less than 1% and inflation is

over 2% the value of your cash

will be eroded over time so if you're

low risk investment you'll be making a

negative return at the moment. If we dial

up the risk by buying the FTSE 100

then in a typical year you've got to be

willing to accept to gain or loss of

twenty percent and remember that's just

a typical year. During a crisis you

should expect to lose fifty percent of

your capital if you invest in equity and

the reason why you accept that risk is

to get access to the upside, an upside

which you just don't have if you invest

in cash. Here are the year-on-year

returns for the FTSE 100 going back

to the late 1980s. Over this 30-year

period the average annual return was

about eight percent and that's a real

return so it incorporates inflation but

it doesn't incorporate the dividends you'd

have received. That may push up your

returns by about two to three percent.

Here's fifty years data for the S&P 500

and the return is a little bit higher

around eleven percent but that's the

kind of return you should expect over

the long term for taking equity risk. The

purpose of showing you this was to

calibrate your return expectations: if

you take equity risk you should expect

between eight and ten percent returns

over the very long term. So for a very

safe investment we should expect

negative returns. For accepting that risk

roller coaster of buying the FTSE 100

we should expect long-term returns of

around eight percent. So now we've

calibrated your expectations:

zero or negative return for a safe

investment, around eight percent for

stock market risk and for a very

risky investment perhaps we should

expect more than ten percent over the

long term, but if you see a promise of

more than ten percent return over the

long term you know for a fact that that

investment must be very risky. It must be

more risky than the UK stock market. Now

let's apply your calibrated expectations

about risk and return. The table lists

recommended brokers for binary options.

Let's focus on the payout column. Do you

see those percentages are between ninety

percent and a hundred percent? What does

that tell you about the risk of these

investments? When you see a number like

ninety percent return that should make

your risk alarm bells start ringing and

if you look at the text on the website

it lays out those risks. With a binary

option there are just two possible

outcomes: either you gain between

sixty-five percent or ninety five

percent on the trade or if it's

unsuccessful you can lose the full

amount of your investment. That's why I

don't believe that binary options are

investments I believe that they're a

form of gambling. Here's another example.

Take a look at the text of the tweet. Now

you're clued up to risk there are three

words that should really stand out in

the text: ""high guaranteed returns"". Remember

what we learned. A high return means the

investment is risky. A guaranteed

return, on the other hand, needs a very

low return and when you see the phrase

""high guaranteed returns"" that should set

your risk alarm bells ringing because

there's no such thing as a high

guaranteed return. If the return is

guaranteed it will be a low return. What

you certainly can guarantee is that

somewhere in this investment will be a

high risk. Let's put it all together into

our Dodginess Scorecard. Look for

misleading promises of risk and return

in other words offers of high returns

but no mention of the risks that go with

those returns, and as we saw the word

""guaranteed"" should never be used in

conjunction with ""return"" because there's

really no such thing as a guaranteed

return.

A return greater than ten percent means

that you're taking a very large risk

greater than that of the stock market in

fact where in a typical year you lose

twenty percent. Watch out for short term

investments. Any mention of quick profits

should set your risk alarm bells ringing.

Always think of investment as a

long-term proposition. Investments which

are infrequently traded are very

illiquid, that means it's very difficult

to know what the price is for your

investment, and in a crisis you may not

be able to sell your investment. Don't

trust advertisements where they give a time

limit. Always take your time to consider

the investment, never make an impulsive

decision. It's very easy to check on the

FCA website whether a firm is authorized,

remember it's riskier to buy from an

unregulated company. And, finally, did they

call you? Because if they did you're

probably prey to a scam. It's best not to

be the prey. Be a return predator. The FCA

ScamSmart website lists a lot of the

scams, and it also gives you some of the

warning signs to watch out for. So why

not help us find some of these

misleading advertisements. The person who

provides us with the best example is going to

a win a bottle of champagne. Look at our

website for the terms and conditions of

the competition, and we wish you good

hunting!

45,Misleading,"This is a bit of a rollercoaster, please bear with me as I try to piece it together coherently.

My friend put her details into some kind of investment finder website. She was contacted by someone (in Germany, allegedly) who said they could get her amazing deals. She invested £300 and they matched it and within 3 days the account had £683, with the guy saying he's made her £83 already.

He then tells her he has a big project coming up next week and if she invests 10k, she will get back between 30 and 40k in January (2024). Plus £500 a month until then. She doesn't have that kind of money, and he urged her to ask family and friends for it or take out a loan. She applied for a personal loan and was accepted.

She wasn't sure how to send the money, so gave this guy remote access to her pc and phone and he used this to send himself the money (she agreed to this). The bank blocked her bank account.

This is when I found out about it and I started looking into this. The company name he has given doesn't exist. She asks him about this and he says they're part of JP Morgan. We contacted JP morgan and they said this isn't true.

She received a contract that was 2 pages long and poorly written with a business number on the top for a completely different business.

I told her to tell him that she would get a solicitor to look at the contract and he was on the phone 10 seconds later telling her he will explain anything she doesn't understand, so no need to get legal advice.

She called her bank to get them to unblock her account and they stated this seemed like fraud and not to continue with the payment.

Despite all of this, he has been on the phone to her, telling her that he cares about her and talking about how he has a family just like her and is just trying to make her money. He's very pushy. He has been in near constant contact via WhatsApp. When she questioned him, he sent a picture of his driving License as some kind of proof of who he is (?), the guy isn't on anything, no social media, nothing.

So despite all of the worrying signs, she says she's going to go for it.

Please give advice or anything I can pass on to her to get her to see this is a scam - or am I totally paranoid here?!"

unique.

Also, it goes back before computers, so why
don't you talk a little about that.

JOHN BOLLINGER: I started right at the juncture
of hand driven analysis and computer driven

analysis.

Of course, we had things like HP calculators
and such like that to aid in the process but

when I started, we mostly calculated indicators
by hand, we kept trading butters, big like

accountants pads with row of dates and times
down one side and rows of prices and various

instruments we were interested in, and then
the various indicators and we didn't calculate

many indicators because it took a long time.

One of the benefits of doing that is we got
to know those indicators intimately.

We really understood how they behaved in different
phases of market action.

As we made the transition to computers, that
knowledge gave an advantage to those who then

were able to take advantage of the of the
speed and power of computers, because we knew

what to tell the computers to do.

Today, people will walk up to a computer and
they want the computer to answer questions

for them, but we drove it the other way.

We wanted the computers to do work for us.

TOM THORNTON: That's fascinating.

The basis of Bollinger Bands is trend and
volatility.

JOHN BOLLINGER: Absolutely.

TOM THORNTON: Tell us a little about your
indicators, you have three you mentioned to

me that you use as your secret sauce.

JOHN BOLLINGER: I don't know if it's a secret
sauce, it's pretty public, but I use Bollinger

Bands which are a type of trading band that
is driven by volatility.

It's the defaults are a 20-day moving average
and the upper band is two standard deviations

of the same data that you use to calculate
the moving average plotted above and then

the same interval plotted below.

Those bands, like all bands, many types, Donchian
bands, percentage bands, Keltner bands, etc.,

they all answer the same question.

They all answer the question as to whether
prices are relatively high or relatively low.

You can then use that information to create
trading systems and defined trading approaches.

When I started, we had an assumption about
volatility.

We thought that volatility was stable, like
the sky is blue or the house is white.

For example, we thought IBM's beta, which
is a measure of volatility, was 1.1 and that

was it.

We calculated once it a year using five years
of weekly data because we didn't think that

it changed much.

I was an option trader so I was very lucky
I had an early computer.

One day, I copied a formula for volatility
down a column of data, and I saw that was

changing a lot.

We have been searching for a way to automate
the changes in trading bands because we would

mostly use percentage trading bands in those
days.

As the regime change, you'd have to tighten
the bands or expand the bands.

When you did so, you'd let emotions into the
process.

If you're bullish, you draw the bands to present
a bullish picture.

If you're bearish-- so I really wanted to
avoid that.

I was looking for a way to automate the setting
it with the bands, and I saw volatility changing

so like, aha, that might be it.

It turned out that it was exactly the right
way to make trading bands adaptive.

TOM THORNTON: The aha moment?

JOHN BOLLINGER: Yeah, exactly.

It earned a Nobel, not for me, it earned a
Nobel for Robert Angle about 10 years ago.

The Nobel Committee recognized how important
that observation of volatility was volatile

was, he did work on inflation in the very
early '80s and it was exactly the same time

that I did my work on Bollinger Bands.

What it was is that was in the air, people
were beginning to question those assumptions

and it's that questioning process that's so
important.

TOM THORNTON: That leads me into something
that I think is really important right now.

There's a lot of assumptions, things that
people ""know"" in the markets these days, and

I have a list of six of them that I thought
we could discuss, and you can give me your

opinion on things that people just assume
are the standard.

Let's go right into indexing.

JOHN BOLLINGER: Well, just to start with,
my idea is to question everything.

I think that that's what everybody should
do.

You should look at all these ideas that are
out there and question everything.

For instance, indexing has byproducts that
people don't really recognize.

The more you index, the more you weld the
prices of all securities together.

If you start indexing something like the OEX,
which has 100 stocks in it, when you buy or

sell that basket, you move all 100 at the
same time, that's what I mean by welding them

together, but now, you start indexing the
S&P 500 and it's 500 stocks, you start indexing

the Russell 1000, 2000 or 3000 and you're
really indexing the whole market, just gluing

the whole thing together.

Out of that, did comes a destruction of diversification.

That's one of the things that I think people
should be questioning, is the benefits of

this diversification.

We've seen, as we saw in the 2006, '07, and
'08 period, when the market came under real

pressure, correlations for virtually all investable
assets merged on one.

What we mean by that is that everything went
down together, even things that weren't supposed

to because professionals, when they come under
pressure, if they can't sell what it is they

need to sell, they sell something else, they
sell whatever they can sell.

TOM THORNTON: Diversification was another
one that people say it's great to be, you

got to be diversified.

It works well when everything is going up
but when it's going down, like you said, correlation.

It's all together and there's nowhere to hide.

JOHN BOLLINGER: Right.

That's really, I think, a byproduct of this
mania for indexing.

The whole thing was 10, 15 years ago, the
idea was that if you just invested in the

market, if you just bought the S&P 500, you
were entitled, entitled to earn 8%, 9%, 10%

a year for the rest of your life just for
the act of having indexed.

Well, we all know the market doesn't actually
work that way.

We came into circa 2000 and an entire generation
of people who are facing retirement over the

next 10 or 15 years, the baby boomers made
that assumption.

They bought those index funds, and they said,
aha, if I go up at 8% per year for the next

15 years, I'm going to have everything I need
to retire.

Well, the market didn't cooperate.

It went sideways for 15 years, and so it didn't
deliver virtually any returns, well, it did

deliver a little bit of dividend income, but
it didn't get delivered the 8%, 9%, 10% that

many people had promised that they would earn
if they indexed.

These assumptions, I think they're very dangerous
and it's very important that we question them.

Very easy to say, index and you'll be safe,
but it's a bigger question than that.

TOM THORNTON: Well, one of the things that
you see on TV and you hear from everyone,

the market's having a great year, but if you
go year over year, and here we are in the

end of October.

If you go back a month, the S&P was basically
flat for a 12 -month period.

Your concern with indexing is if things go
sideways, or let's say they go down, that's

a large risk for the average investor.

Now, the average investor another thing, ETFs
are safe.

JOHN BOLLINGER: Well, yeah.

One of the things that indexing has done and
I don't think people realize yet and it's

the same story with ETFs is it's made stock
picking more attractive.

The market's going sideways over the past
timeframe as you suggested, there were many

opportunities in the individual stocks to
make it better than market return and many

professional managers, many hedges and many
just ordinary investors, people who still

thought about investing in individual stocks
rather than in indexes or funds of various

sorts, they were able to do very well over
the past year, but on average, the returns

just weren't there.

I think there's a really good aspect ETFs.

The ability to buy like individual sectors
or very specialized pieces of the market and

experience that return chain that ETFs can
offer, I think that's a fabulous opportunity

for investors and if they go after that wisely,
I think that that can be a tremendous benefit,

but this panacea idea, buy the ETF and you'll
be okay, well, not so much.

TOM THORNTON: Well, there's another thing,
too, that on assumption, liquidity is great

in the market.

JOHN BOLLINGER: Well, yeah, liquidity is great
in the market, isn't it?

But it's only great until it's not great as
we saw in-- as we saw so clearly in the 2006,

2007, 2008 sequence.

There were times when you really couldn't
sell anything.

It just wasn't possible, they were not fit.

It seemed like a very liquid market because
the volumes were there, but the volumes were

created by people engaging in capitulation.

I don't think people normally think of capitulation
and liquidity in the same breath, but I think

they should.

The idea that liquidity will be there when
you need it, I think that that's probably

a false idea and that you ought to be ready
to field some defense when the going gets

rough.

Before the going gets rough that is, and I
think this idea that market timing is somehow

not a reputable idea.

I think that's crazy.

I think you have to engage in market timing,
you have to recognize times when the risks

are increasing, and the dangers are building
up, especially in these days with all this

index going on, and all these securities welded
together.

TOM THORNTON: Yeah, I would agree 100% with
your thoughts on the sectors because sectors

will rotate and that's a natural thing throughout
the year.

You'll see technology go up and go down.

You'll see the energy market especially is
a very good one.

I think that's really important and I'm a
market timer as well so I 100% agree.

JOHN BOLLINGER: Yeah.

I don't understand why market timing is in
disrepute.

I think it's an in central discipline.

I don't think that that means that you buy
everything by 100% today, and sell 100% tomorrow,

which is what some people think market timing
is, but I think good market timers recognize

when risks are increasing and some money ought
to be taken off the table or as we often say

on the street, we already got a little closer
to home.

TOM THORNTON: Yeah, exactly.

Okay, one other thing that I have thought
about, and it's an important day today because

of the Fed's meeting, don't fight the Fed.

JOHN BOLLINGER: Well, that was one of Marty
Zweig's two big maxims, don't fight the Fed

and don't fight the tape, both of which in
their time, they were perfect.

They described the best set of behaviors in
relation to market that could be imagined.

In this last interest rate cycle with zero
interest rates, I think that don't fight the

Fed part of it is been called into question
in a pretty dramatic way.

We found in certain environments that falling
interest rates are, in fact not a good scenario

for stocks and that, in fact, rising interest
rates might be a good scenario for stocks.

That's the opposite of the perceived wisdom.

It has also done a lot of damage to academic
theory.

For example, what is the Sharpe ratio when
interest rates are zero?

TOM THORNTON: You can't calculate it.

JOHN BOLLINGER: I think these are very challenging
times in which you need to look at the realities

of the marketplace and keep yourself tuned
to them.

Another example is this has been a very bad
news year.

We've had tremendously volatile news, good,
bad, etc., virtually continuous news cycle

of stuff that upset people, made people uncomfortable,
made people unhappy yet on balance, the market's

done okay through this.

You couldn't have convinced anybody say five
years ago then if we went through this news

cycle, stocks would actually be trying to
break out which is what they're doing now.

You would have thought that it would have
created a bear market.

TOM THORNTON: That's been this ping pong battle
over the 50-day moving average back and forth

with tweets and everything.

Okay, let's talk a little about current times
right now.

What do you think of some markets, like the
US markets, do you have anything to talk about,

rates?

JOHN BOLLINGER: Well, there's a whole bunch
talk about.

A lot of people are trying to hide in bonds
right now and bonds have the worst risk reward

ratios that you can imagine.

What's the upside for buying a bond now?

You get a couple percent income and if rates
continue down, seems highly unlikely since

they're near zero to start with, you get a
tiny bit of capital appreciation.

If rates rise just to historic norms, and
you say own a 10-Year Treasury, you're going

to be looking at a 50% decline in the value
of your capital.

The potential reward in bond is very small.

The risk should inflation reignite, I guess
nobody believes that we'll ever have inflation

again, which means that it will be a show
up tomorrow morning, but if inflation's reignite,

these bond portfolios that are bought at interest
rates of 1% and 2% and 3%, when we go to interest

rates of 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, those portfolios
are going to be destroyed.

My whole has always been fine, trades where
the risk and reward ratios are in your favor

for example, with Bollinger Bands, you make
a W bottom in relation to the Bollinger Bands.

You can put on trade, you can risk a relatively
small amount with a defined potential, nothing

guaranteed about it but it's defined potential.

You can put on a trade with risk and reward
criteria are in your favor and the odds of

success are also in your favor because you
go back and test it and say, well, this trade

worked 66% of the time which is to say two
out of three times and I risk a few percent,

4% or 5% on the downside and maybe the reward's
10%, 20% so you have a decent success rate

and you have a decent risk reward ratio.

That's positive for investors.

That's the thing that you can actually make
money with over the years and keep volatility

down the opposite, which is what bonds are
now where risk is huge and reward's tiny.

I think that's suicide.

I understand that that there's a perceived
safety-ness in bonds but I think we ought

to question that assumption.

It's one of those assumptions.

TOM THORNTON: Yeah, absolutely.

The other thing that makes me just crazy is
its capital appreciation, what bond investors

have achieved this year and nice dividend
paying-- JOHN BOLLINGER: George, life that

in.

TOM THORNTON: Buy stocks for nice high dividends
so when you have the stock market yielding

more than the bond market and bond investors
are trying to get capital appreciation, it's

whacky.

JOHN BOLLINGER: That was a holy grail set
of indicators, the bond stock ratios and such

like that, both for quality and for high quality
bonds, for junk bonds, for low price stocks,

for high price stocks, so on and so forth.

There's a whole basket of the of those indicators,
and they worked for years and years and years.

But in the zero interest rate environment,
those indicators are moot.

They just-- I don't know what they mean in
this environment, but they don't mean what

they used to mean.

It's not to say that they're not worthwhile,
that they're not generating information, but

it's not the information that they used to
generate.

If you try to operate those on the old rules,
you're going to get your clock cleaned, but

there may in fact be uses for that information
in this new environment.

I just haven't explored that.

TOM THORNTON: Well, the Fed in a few hours
from now, and when everybody watches it, they'll

know they cut or they cut another 25 basis
points, is it just mindboggling to you that

they're cutting rates at S&P 3000 all-time
highs, low unemployment?

JOHN BOLLINGER: It's not so much mindboggling
that they're doing that.

What's mindboggling is the sequence of rate
rises that preceded this which were totally

unnecessary.

Their excuse was that, oh, we want to get
rates up to a point so that we have some ammunition

should we need it.

Really?

Is that the way you run monetary policy?

We want to make sure that we got a stack of
bullets here and that's not-- I did not think

that that was the job of the Fed.

I think that that sequence of rate rises forced
them into this sequence of decline, and I

agree with you, they should not be in the
situation of having to cut rates into a very

high valuation environment.

I think the latest GDP indication we just
got is 1.9%.

That's not negative GDP.

Those aren't recession numbers.

That's not back to back negative quarters
of GDP, which is what the Fed ought to be

fighting with lower rates.

TOM THORNTON: Right, and unemployment at 3.50%,
and it's just really.

JOHN BOLLINGER: 10, 15 years ago, my thing
that I argued was the most important thing

was not the unemployment rate, but the total
percentage of the US population that was working,

the employment rate.

That had declined dramatically for many years
and then went to a static record.

That's now rising.

As you point out, 3.50% unemployment, but
you can look on the other side of that, and

that number looks very good as well, after
a long time where that number looked hopeless

for the future.

More and more people being employed as a percent
to population, I think that's a very positive

trend.

I don't think anybody's talking about that.

TOM THORNTON: Yeah, I think you're right.

Well, I want to wrap it up with a question
on what you think is the most pressing issue

right now for investors in the market?

JOHN BOLLINGER: Well, I think the most pressing
issue is the same issue that it always is,

it's discipline.

We've too many people invest in an undisciplined
manner, but have to have a rigorous rational

approach to investing and we have to employ
it come whatever the market does.

I think that these assumptions that we should
index or somehow, that we don't have to take

responsibility for investing.

The typical man or woman out there has a job.

They may have probably have a partner, they
might have a family that they're trying to

put together a future, so they're generating
some income and they're putting into savings.

Well, investing is part of their job and they
need to realize that.

You have two choices, either you can do it
yourself or you can pay somebody to do it

for you, an investment manager.

You can examine their track record and their
discipline and what their ideas are and see

if it suits you and to suit your approach.

But this idea that somehow that they're just
returns, that they come to you from the fact

of investing.

Not so much.

It's work.

It's a job and it has to be done and has to
be done with discipline.

TOM THORNTON: It's going to get harder out
there.

JOHN BOLLINGER: Yeah, I think it will.

These are extraordinary times.

This is a zero interest rate environment that
we're in.

We've never seen anything like it before.

We have to really pay very close attention
to what's happening.

There are real risks out there, but there
are real opportunities out there.

I'm not a Cassandra in any way whatsoever.

I'm actually very bullish on equities here.

I think stocks are going to do well for quite
a while, at least into the end of the year

and early into next year.

I'm not a Cassandra.

I just think that we need to do some work.

TOM THORNTON: Well, I'll leave it at that.

John, it was great to meet you.

Thank you for coming on Real Vision.

Everyone, I just want to say thank you for
having me.

I feel honored to interview John and we'll
see you again soon.

48,Misleading,"They spend all their money on seminars. And there they come wearing suits. If you go there, you will feel that the board meeting of Singhania or Oberois is going on. Our government is being accused every day of unemployment and poverty. Opening an account in MNREGA. The government should collect all these poor and assign a representative. And start connecting three men from every village, poverty will completely end. So why is the government not doing this? This is a chain where you are fooled first, you are then trained in workshops and seminars. so that you can fool others. There are no customers here. Everyone here is a distributor and a distributor has been making a distributor under himself To join MLM, no age, qualification, skill, or interview nothing is required. you should have only one thing, you should have money to buy a welcome kit You are already dealing with financial problems and by connecting with them, Your friends also get annoyed with you. Tata, Birla, Ambani Adani, all the profitable businesses of India From salt to software development, they are now involved in everything. Why have they never come up with a three-man scheme till today? Before we go any further, let's talk about our sponsors, RELEVEL Through RELEVEL people have got jobs not from college but skill. Like Pratham Mishra, He wrote a frontend test and today got a high paying job in Wingify On the strength of his skills through RELEVEL by Unacademy bringing a 5-day Relevel select event Where you can give simple and free tests you can get access to times network, Wingify And you can get a job offer in a good company like Hypto. By clearing the test you will get the job along with this there are also prices  for top scorers worth ₹30,000, and the toppers of the entire event will get goodies as well as a MacBook, iPhone 13, and iWatch, last month only, jobs worth 36 lacks were delivered daily by Relevel. This event is for frontend backend and full-stack test And the company is offering a package of 10 to 15 lakhs, go to relevel today and And book your slot between 1st to 5th June. The event is for tech but you can take a job in 18 different domains. HR, sales, product management everything is available  I have given the link in the description. Firstly, what is MLM Multi-level Marketing, pyramid scheme, network marketing, chain and referral marketing and All these things are the same or different and more importantly whether it is legal in India or not. And if it is not legal then what are the tricks used to make it legal. The pyramid scheme was introduced in India for the first time in 1995 which happened for the first time that people used to get money without giving any service or goods. And for this, they only had to add men under themselves. Because there is a man at the top of this scheme and under him are two men. And then there are 4 men and a pyramid type structure is formed. So it's called the pyramid scheme Now you will say what is the problem with this? earning is on, no one is being harmed but there is a big problem Suppose I am the owner of a company.  I added 6 people under me. This became the first level, now these 6 people will add 6 people under their So for a total of 36 people, this has become the second level. Now, these 36 people will add 6-6 people under them, so it became 216 people. This is the third level. Similarly, there will be 1,296 people on the fourth level. By doing this, you will reach the 12th level so 2.1 billion people would be needed. There is no such population in India. Similarly, when you go to the 30th step, more than 13 billion people will be needed and the whole world also doesn't have that much population. This is the reason that the people who are on the top, on the first or the second layer, they make money for the people at the bottom where there are maximum people are not able to make money In the area where you live, there must be 1000 to 2000 people living there. You will be at a loss in 1-2 levels only.  That's why this pyramid scheme has been designed in such a way that it's bound to fail in the end The first 1 to 2 layers earn but 99% of people's money is lost in this. It is riskier than playing a gamble you will feel that you are not getting rich because you are not able to add people but the reality is that you are in the lower layer. You will not be able to blame MLM companies. You will feel that it is your fault, You could not add people this Is Why Pyramid Scheme Is banned in India under new consumer protection rule If you take money from someone  in money circulation, MLM, and pyramid schemes so it's an illegal activity For which you can also be jailed under Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes Act you will say that if it is banned and it is illegal then how are the companies operating it? By Manipulating the entire model, MLM companies  merged to direct selling Direct selling means companies bring their products to the people through distributors and marketing. Word-of-mouth works in direct selling which means Marketing through people. The product went to a man, and now he is selling that product to his friends and family And if that product sells then he gets his incentive But it is to be noted that money is received for selling the product, not for connecting people These companies apply the angle for connecting people Under the guise of direct marketing, pyramid schemes are being run so that they don't go to jail Ever since the company linked this pyramid structure with Products Since then it has become multi-level marketing And the government can't do anything about it. Because some people genuinely in India are running their business from Direct Selling. That is why the government gives guidelines every day don't fall into the MLM trap Until it was not banned, companies had taken money from people. And used to tell them that you have to add three people under you. As people will join by paying money, you and those who are above you will continue to get money And this chain will grow and you will become rich overnight. And after being banned, they linked it to products and services. They bring any product, medicine, or eBook And the money that used to be taken from the pyramid scheme now it is taken through the welcome kit. 50-60 products are added to this welcome kit. The goods which are of ₹ 500 were sold in 2000. so that the pyramid scheme can be run this is the reason any product of MLM It will be 20 to 30 times more expensive than the market rate They run their pyramid model with the extra money they take If you ask them why are your products so expensive So they would say that it is a game-changer, such a product has not yet come into the market. Some of their products are such that they can also cure sugar and cancer. think carefully about Tata, Birla who has so much money and have a large research team They have years of experience and they have the best talent in the whole of India. They can't make soap, toothpaste and kit and the new companies of MLM in the market which has come in 4 days, they can make it. The reality is that they run a pyramid scheme under the guise of a product. Sometimes in the name of a course or product, you will notice all MLM companies are more interested in connecting its under 3 people than selling the product. Instead of marketing and advertising their products, they spend more money on seminars. In which all of them come wearing suits. If you go there, you will feel that board meeting of Singhania's or Oberoi's is   going on. This money is spent on seminars so that people give money only after seeing the dazzle and join them and after seeing their seminars, you will feel that they are working on some mission. And that mission is not understood by the whole world. Their products are never famous and no one is interested in them. They neither spend ₹ 1 on marketing nor you will get to see any of their advertisements All their interest remains in the money they get by adding people. If I talk about those who are currently associated with MLM So ask yourself if they hadn't sold you dreams of financial freedom Income of 6 to 7 figure, be your own Boss, passive income had not sold all these dreams  would you have bought such expensive products from the market? you never buy, you have put money in the starter pack and joining fee Because you got to hope to get out of your current situation Another thing maybe people have less understanding of MLM. And do not understand its secret knowledge But you see with a little logic Tata, Birla, Ambani Adani, all the profitable businesses of India From salt to software development, they are now involved in everything. Even then, why did not these people come up with the scheme of three people till today? They provide referrals that if you refer their product to someone then you will get some benefit but they never came up with a three-person scheme. And they never share profit among the people Because they know if their product will be good and marketing will be right so there has to be profitable and will not share that profit with anyone Only MLM people share profit from top to bottom. Leave them aside and if we talk about our government which is abused every day due to unemployment and poverty and opening accounts in MNREGA The government should collect all these poor and assign a representative And start connecting 3 people from each village. All poverty will end So why don't they do this? The reality is that MLM is not a business model. And I am saying this because when a normal company makes a product gives it to the distributor, from distributor to customer. Marketing is done, it costs a lot of money in ads. But if we talk about MLM, then there is no customer here. Everyone is a distributor, a distributor is making a distributor under himself. You will never understand whether you are a seller, distributor or a customer And you will not get the answer to this thing till the end In normal business, by investing money in the business, the owner would have taken the risk. Connects people with himself and gives them a salary after they get profit and the owner never share that profit this is the reason why the owner of the company takes interviews 10 times and sees the skill, education, and age even after that, if he does not understand, then he fires. But in  MLM, you are also investing money and you are also taking the risk of that money. It is a far away from getting a salary, you are giving money to that company. And then working for that company too. And you are also giving profit for the 3 people you have connected under you and the owner of MLM company is roaming freely That's why to connect with MLM you do not need education, skills , interview and any age You only need to have money to buy the welcome kit even if you're a kid once you give them money whether you work or not no one will fire you. And If you want to do this, then what do you need to join a company for this? go to a factory and take 4-5 products from there and start adding people under you What do you need a company for? This is also wrong but I am just telling you to explain. Get them to sign a legal bond of the things they are promising they will never sign. You tell them to lend me, I will return you after adding 3 people Because business is 100% successful, they will never lend, this is a chain where you are fooled first, you are then trained in workshops and seminars. so that you can fool others. If you have seen the movie Resident Evil There's a zombie in it that bites a man so that man also becomes a zombie. Then those people also get involved in making other people zombies. The same thing is happening in MLM too. Every person has a dream to do something for his family members, to get out of your current situation Not listening to the abuse of the boss, when all the roads are closed, The MLM people come as hope and to refuse them means to close all doors to the one hope that came in your life. That's why you listen to them, they come to you first and do the same thing. They ask you if you are happy with your income and obviously, you will refuse It won't tell you till the end what to do.  They have a sir, they are very busy. They are waiting for him and they will continue to explain it to you for 1 to 2 hours. And when they see some potential in you, then they will make you meet the sir. You will be told how poor they were before, and how this thing changed their lives For a long time, these people used to show cheques, Then people said that the cheques get deposited in the bank why are you showing Later all these things are reduced, In these, your security is also at risk. In the race to connect three people, if you are stuck with any person and if his money is stuck then he will ask for money from you, not the company There have been such cases many times that people get beaten up. Many people have lost their lives too There is a book ""My Father's Dream"" by Erik German, you must read it In this, he told how their life was ruined because of MLM. You are already dealing with financial problems and by connecting with them, Your friends also get annoyed with you, they also explain to you how they get rejections in the beginning but even after that, keep it up and see where they are today That's why you keep doing the same thing. Some of your wise friends will explain to you. For them, they will say that stay away from negative people they will not let you grow Some companies sell products using MLM But their product is reputed in the market and the ads of their product are running. And everyone knows that particular product And its core will be direct marketing. Meaning you will get money from selling the product, but you won't get money for adding people under you or buying a welcome kit. As people are coming on the internet,   people have become aware of MLM. But now these companies have also become very professional and organized. Sometimes they will bring online courses, e-books They come with different models, it will not look like MLM but it will work as MLM You have to be very careful, and in today's time it has become very difficult to understand Because of the fancy names, you'll find out later that it's a pyramid scheme. Now you have to observe very carefully, if you want to add people at any stage, then leave It's a trap, well these companies already know what's going to happen That's why they keep all their arrangements. But still, if you get stuck then complain. So that they do not fool the rest of the people in the future. First of all, approach a lawyer and send them a notice secondly file an FIR at the police station and initiate a criminal case and also make a complaint against the Registrar of Companies.

49,Misleading,"I have some bad news for you…

You are probably not going to be rich.

Not a particularly positive message to start
a video on but its something that people need

to hear from time to time.

Unfortunately, this is not something that
most people want to hear, so there is no shortage

of people out there that will tell you exactly
the opposite, normally as a way to pitch you

some kind of product.

Now of course most of you watching know that
the YouTube ads saying that you can earn 6

figures in a month by selling on Amazon, Forex
trading, or flipping real estate are full

of shit.

But they still all follow a pretty similar
routine,

hey, you can get rich

as long as you are willing to do XYZ

while listening to the advice I give you!

Again when it turns out that this advice is
something that you have to pay for, most people

get wise to the fact that it’s all just
a massive scam.

Of course some don’t, which is tragic and
there really genuinely should be more done

about this, but that’s a story for another
time… or a coffeezilla video.

Instead the focus of this video will be on
a group of internet guru’s with much more

influence, a much larger following, and much
more credibility, the personal finance personalities.

So it’s time to learn how money works and
find out why you probably shouldn’t be learning

to work your money like these popular youtubers
might suggest.

Now I want to preface this by saying that
I personally enjoy watching people like Graham

Stephan, Andre Jink, and from time to time
even dave ramsey (as a guilty pleasure).

None of these guys are outright nefarious
scammers like the hustle bros you will see

pitching an amazon automation course and this
automatically makes them a million times better

than this other group.

What’s more is that they are genuinely entertaining,
they give people a sneak peek into their own

success while presenting relatively dry content
in a way that is funny and easy to understand.

The problem is though.

Personal Finance should be boring.

There is a common saying that everything you
need to know about personal finance should

be able to fit on a postcard, some authors
have actually done it.

But when you are committing to an upload schedule
of a 15 minute video every single day of every

single week you are going to run out of things
on that post card to talk about.

Now this is no good, because as these people
will show you, they make millions of dollars

a year from their daily video’s so they
are not exactly going to turn around and say

“oh well I have taught you everything you
need to know now… so long and thanks for

all the fish”

Of course not that would be silly… and I
am sure any one of us that is in there position

would do the same thing that they are, which
is riding that damn gravy train for as long

as they can.

But to do this they need to create more content
than what this posted note can provide so

they branch out into a few different broad
categories.

Personal Stories About Their Success

Reactions

Predictions

And making up new lessons

Now to start off with lets look at the least
problematic of these formats, reaction video’s.

Reaction videos are everywhere on youtube,
and they they get a bit of a bad rap.

But when you think about it this video format
can range from absolutely terrible all the

way to genuinely value adding and informative.

The video’s that people like Graham or Kevin
make are normally towards the good end.

They will normally react to personal finance
by watching video series like millennial money

or they talk about high end real estate which
is obviously an area of extensive expertise

for these guys.

There are other’s like Dave Ramsey who will
do live reactions to people that call into

the show and despite these being a bit repetitive
they aren’t really doing any harm (apart

from the ego’s of the callers)

If you want to argue that these live interviews
are not really reaction video’s just think

to yourself, “am I watching this to see
the solution to the persons problem, oooorrrrr

am I watching this to smugly partake in Dave’s
reaction to this persons situation?”

Even still this is just a bit of light entertainment
and who knows, maybe you will pick up a nugget

of information along the way.

No problems there, apart from when these reactions
turn into predictions…

Financial predictions are almost impossible
to make… even the largest financial firms

in the world filled with teams of PHD Quantitative
Analysts struggle to outperform regular market

returns consistently, if at all.

It’s therefore frustrating to see someone
like Meet Kevin, make predictions about the

future of a highly volatile stock like Tesla
before his audience…

and yes I know… he gives the standard disclaimer
“that this is not financial advice”, but

when a supposably reputable figure that positions
themselves as a personal finance expert brings

up an official looking spreadsheet and predicts
100% within the next 12 months… well it’s

not unrealistic to see how some of his impressionable
audience would follow his not advice.

Now this is just one of the most blatant examples,
but all of these personal finance personalities

is guilty of giving these “not advice”
pieces of advice throughout their content.

This can range anywhere from invest into dividend
stocks, all the way up to only buy a duplex

and rent out the other side.

Both pieces of advice that are not necessarily
bad, but are just grossly overgeneralised

and make no accommodations for the financial
situations of their viewers.

Now my friend Richard over at the plain bagel
actually made a video earlier this week that

explored the issue of picking stocks from
the perspective of an actual financial professional

who’s job it is to pick stock for clients.

I was actually considering not making this
video at all after seeing that one because

I thought Mr Bagel made a pretty fair and
well rounded argument against this all…

but then….

I saw this…

Alright, this is where the serious issues
start.

Making up new rules for people to follow.

I hate to be the one to break it to you, and
I truly do mean this in the nicest possible

way.

But Graham Stephan is a ex real estate agent
and social media influencer, HE DOES NOT KNOW

the 5 best investments to make you rich.

For that matter, nobody knows any investments
that will make you rich, and if they did they

sure wouldn’t be sharing them on a YouTube
video.

Despite popular opinions these days, good
investments should not double overnight, they

“should instead” continually provide value
over many years or decades and return that

value back to the investor steadily over the
same time period.

The generally accepted rate of return for
a well-diversified portfolio is anywhere between

6% all the way up to 12% if your doing really
well.

The bad news here is that this is not going
to make you rich, just like we said at the

beginning of the vide.

Well actually it’s not going to make you
rich unless you have a decent income already

and are very disciplined about consistently
contributing to this portfolio over a long

enough time period for compound interest to
do it’s thing.

Even then it will make you old and rich, which
is not what the people want…

What they want is to hear about how the people
talking to them got so rich.

Which is where we get to the last type of
concerning content…

Personal Stories about their success.

Now who doesn’t love a good success story,
especially when it’s the tale of a scrappy

underdog proving all the naysayers wrong.

Which is something most of these guys have.

Graham didn’t get into university, Meet
Kevin started from less than a thousand dollars,

Dave Ramsey went totally bankrupt and the
same is true for the rest of them, none are

turning around and saying I studied like crazy
through high school, got into a good university

then became a doctor or an investment banker.

Why?

Well because it’s much more entertaining,
and it sounds much more attainable to the

average viewer.

And whether we like to admit it to ourselves
or not, there is an element of; “If I watch

these video’s I will learn to do what he
did”

Now that’s not to say these back stories
are all a lie, but more so they are just the

product of survivorship bias.

For every Dave, Graham and Kevin, there are
thousands of people that didn’t have the

unique set of skills and the luck to break
into the incredibly lucrative roles they found

themselves in.

Sure graham didn’t go to university, but
he did work his way into an incredibly prestigious

real estate firm, so what he lacked in book
smarts were obviously more than made up for

with personal branding and good old fashioned
sales ability.

If you are a fantastic salesman then sure
go ahead.

There is actually a widely accepted array
of high paying jobs with varying levels of

effort to certainty.

Sales sits somewhere towards the riskier side
of this array.

Something that is very high effort would be
becoming a surgeon or a dentist, it takes

years and years in medical school, but once
you are practicing you are all but garunteed

a high income and standard of living for the
rest of your life.

Of course at the other end of the spectrum
is something like “becoming a Rockstar,

or famous actor, or yeah even a youtuber….”

It doesn’t take too much effort when compared
to years in med school, or 100 hour weeks

in an investment bank but it’s also incredibly
unlikely to pay off.

Whether they do it intentionally or not the
“personal finance personalities” perpetuate

the narrative of dropping out of school and
building your own destiny, which has worked

for them, but will not work for most people.

It also sounds eerily familiar to the promises
made by the more despicable side of the financial

gurus…

Now there is one last problem with these personal
back stories, and that is that they are used

to justify all of these other pieces of content.

To demonstrate this we are once again going
to pick on Meet Kevin.

One of his most popular video’s is the tale
of how he built up his property portfolio

from $0 to 5.5 million dollars by the age
of 27.

You are welcome to go and watch the video
but the TLDR is that through a series of flips

and equity releases he built up a highly leveraged
position of real estate assets that were cash

flow positive.

Sounds great, but it is ridiculously risky.

Take out 5:1 leveraged position in the stock
market and most people will think you lost

your mind, but take out a 10:1 leveraged position
on a house, and you are an investment genius.

Most people don’t realise how risky real
estate can be.

Now of course Kevin was lucky, he started
investing at the start of one of the longest

real estate bull runs in history and in his
defence he has deleveraged his position significantly

since, but this is the DEFINITION of survivorship
bias.

Nobody is making a video about how they lost
their life savings trying to flip homes.

Had Kevin started his investment journey in
2004, he certainly wouldn’t be telling stories

of financial success on youtube, if anything
he would be lucky to be an extra on the Big

Short.

(play scene of stripper with 5 houses and
a condo)

Now if I sound overly cinical let me follow
this all up by saying given the opportunity

to make as much money as these guys are by
uploading videos to the internet I would sell

out so damn fast…

But they are still selling something, it might
not be a course, or an AI that can trade forex

for you or even a book, but they are selling
you into keep on watching.

Bleak realities about the tough road to reliably
create wealth doesn’t quiet grab attention

like an open mouth and a flashy headline but
in a world where attention is the new currency,

you should spend yours wisely.

Anyway, if you do happen to get rich by following
in their footsteps you should follow that

all up by commenting how dumb I am on this
video and then watching our video on what

to do next after making millions of dollars.

50,Misleading,"Over 30% of TikTok videos on crypto investments 
are misleading! Over 1 in 3 TikTok Influencers  

Post Misleading Crypto Content! A recent study by 
dappGambl has revealed that TikTok influencers are  

posting misleading videos about cryptocurrency 
investments, with over one in three videos found  

to be deceptive. The social media platform has 
become an alternative to Google searches for many  

individuals, particularly younger generations. 
However, some influencers have been found to share  

unvetted misinformation on crypto investments, 
often trying to convince unwary viewers to  

put their hard-earned money into loss-making 
cryptocurrencies.! The analysis of over 1,161  

TikTok videos with the hashtag “#cryptok” revealed 
that only 1 in every 10 cryptok accounts or videos  

contained some form of disclaimer that warned 
users about the risk of investments. Additionally,  

out of the lot, 47% of TikTok creators were 
found trying to push services to make money.  

This lack of accountability and transparency 
highlights the need for better regulation in the  

social media industry.! The potential financial 
risk for unwary investors remains equally high,  

despite TikTok influencers having a smaller 
reach than their mainstream counterparts. The  

study also discovered that popular crypto-related 
hashtags such as crypto, cryptok, cryptoadvice,  

cryptocurrency, cryptotrading, and cryptoinvesting 
have cumulatively churned over 6 billion views on  

TikTok. The platform has become a breeding ground 
for unverified information on crypto investments,  

causing viewers to overlook the ill-intent of 
their favorite influencers and trust their content  

purely based on the high number of views or 
likes.! The consequences of this trend are severe,  

with individuals investing their hard-earned money 
into cryptocurrencies without proper research,  

often resulting in significant financial losses. 
The United States Securities and Exchange  

Commission (SEC) has also cracked down on the 
promotion of cryptocurrencies by influencers. The  

SEC forced Kim Kardashian to pay $1.26 million in 
penalties for the promotion of EthereumMax (EMAX).  

Other mainstream influencers such as Jake Paul 
and Soulja Boy have also been accused of promoting  

cryptocurrencies to their millions of fans 
without disclosing payments received.! On April 2,  

a $1 billion lawsuit was filed against crypto 
exchange Binance, its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao,  

and three crypto influencers for promoting 
unregistered securities. The Moscowitz Law Firm  

and Boies Schiller Flexner, who filed the lawsuit, 
referred to the case as a ""classic example of a  

centralized exchange, which is promoting the sale 
of an unregistered security.""! In conclusion,  

the study by dappGambl highlights the need 
for stricter regulations and accountability  

measures for social media platforms. Both 
new and seasoned investors are advised to do  

extensive research on crypto projects prior 
to making any form of investment. With the  

potential financial risk for unwary investors 
remaining high, it is crucial that social media  

platforms such as TikTok take responsibility 
for the content shared by their influencers,  

and ensure that users are properly warned about 
the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies.!

51,Misleading," Part One of Lesson One of Compliance Bootcamp on Avoiding Deceptive Marketing

If you own or run a business, or hold a position in compliance, legal, marketing or sales, 

you should be familiar with the deceptive marketing provisions of the Competition Act. 

Slide #1 On-screen: Text on graphic: Get familiar with the law. Graphic: Depictions of a business owner, a legal counsel, a compliance expert, a marketer and a salesperson.

In this short lesson, we will explain the important elements of deceptive marketing. 

This will help you make sure that the marketing and sales activities of your business comply with the law.

For Canada’s markets to be fair, its businesses must compete honestly. 

That’s why, when you are promoting your business, products or services, you must not make false or misleading statements about them.

[Slide #2 On-screen: Depiction of a person with a Pinocchio nose working on a laptop. The screen besides this person says: “Don’t mislead consumers”.]

[Slide #3 On-screen: Graphic of a person juggling these icons: Internet symbol, email symbol, hyperlink symbol, text symbol, computer screen symbol, web banner symbol, Tweet symbol, video symbol, dollar symbol, social media profile symbol, link symbol, clipboard symbol, mobile phone symbol, books’ symbol, and gear symbol]

This includes online marketing like web banners, landing pages, text-based hyperlinks, 

emails, text messages, newsletters, blog posts, online ads and social media content.

If your marketing content creates a general impression that is false or misleading, it could be considered deceptive marketing. 

[Slide # 4 On-screen: Graphic depicting the following elements: Courthouse, legal papers, a lawyer at a podium, and law books]

Keep in mind: No one actually needs to be deceived for the general impression to be false or misleading.

Before you make any claims about your business, its products or services, 

you should ask yourself these important questions in order to assess general impression.

1.	Is my marketing content partially false or does it have more than one meaning one of which is false? 

2.	Does my promotional material withhold important information? Is it misleading without this information? 

3.	Do parts of my marketing content, such as the web address or visuals, create a false impression?

4.	Taken together, do the representations I’ve made have the potential to create a false or misleading impression?

[Slide #5 On-screen: Image of a person thinking about these questions: 1) Partially false? More than one meaning? 2) Withholding important info? 3) Visuals create a false impression? 4) Whole meaning isn’t misleading?]

If you answer yes to any of these questions, then you should review your promotional material.

To avoid giving the wrong impression in your marketing materials, here are a few additional tips:

[Slide #6 On-screen: Text: Marketing Tips image: Laptop with these symbols around it: email symbol, time symbol, credit card symbol, planner symbol, and symbol of magnifying glass over content.]

Avoid fine-print disclaimers that restrict or contradict the main message. 

If you use disclaimers, make sure that they only clarify or expand on the main message. 

Disclaimers will not change the general impression if it is otherwise false or misleading. 

Use clear, easily understood language in your marketing copy. Ask unbiased proofreaders to verify that the message is easy to understand.

Fully and clearly disclose all related, and important information. Do not hide key features or information from your customers. 

Now that we’ve talked about how to assess the general impression of your marketing messages, let’s look at performance or efficacy claims. 

These types of representations receive special treatment under the law. To make sure that your marketing materials are not deceptive, 

any claims you make about performance or efficacy must be supported by adequate and proper testing. 

Here are some DO’s and DON’T’S: 

DO make sure that your testing has been conducted before the claim is made.

DO make sure your marketing claims reflect the actual test results.

DO make sure that the testing on which you are basing your claims was done under controlled circumstances.

DON’T make broad claims based on testing that is only partially relevant.

DON’T base your marketing claims on test results that are insignificant or based on mere chance or one-time effect. 

[Slide #8 on-screen:  Text: DON’T make broad claims based on testing that is only partially relevant. Red X: DON’T base your marketing claims on test results that are insignificant or based on mere chance or one-time effect.]

It is your responsibility to prove that the marketing claims you make are based on adequate and proper testing. 

To comply with the law, testing must be done before any marketing claims are made. So, test it before you market it!

[Slide #9 on-screen: Text: Test it before you market it! Image: Scientist performing a test in a lab, in this case by looking into a microscope.]

Let’s turn to influencer marketing. The Competition Act still applies if you are working with influencers.

[Slide #10 on-screen: Image of an influencer speaking out of a mobile phone with a bullhorn in order to attract potential followers and customers.]

“Influencer marketing” is marketing just the same - both parties must remember that they are making marketing claims to consumers.

There is nothing wrong with influencer marketing, as long as the connection between the business and the influencer is clear to the public.

Like marketers, influencers must clearly disclose relevant information related to their marketing claims. 

If the influencer receives any benefit from or has a connection to the business, it is important to disclose that to the public.

[Slide #11 on-screen: Text: Disclose connections. Graphic: Cellphone with people around it holding different signs with the following icons on the signs: dollar bill icon, commissions’ icon, discounts’ icon, trip icon, family connection icon, free ticket icon, and connections’ icon. There is one icon per sign.

A “connection” could be getting paid or receiving commissions, free products or services, 

or discounts, in exchange for promoting a business, product or service. 

It could also mean a friend or family connection with the business. 

When working with influencers, your business shares a responsibility for their promotional messages. 

[Slide #12 on-screen: Text: Shared Responsibility. Image of people attracted by a social media profile. This is depicted with a magnet coming out of a cellphone that has a social media profile on it, and with 6 social media users moving towards the magnet.

You could be liable for false or misleading content. Therefore, you should always review their content carefully.

[Slide #13 on-screen: Image of a cellphone depicting a review with the words “Authentic reviews” written above it.]

Finally, a word about online reviews and testimonials. These must also be authentic experiences and opinions of impartial consumers.

Now, let’s turn to the rules around pricing. 

The practice of offering attractive headline prices and then adding additional mandatory fees later in the transaction 

is sometimes referred to as drip pricing.

[Slide #14 on-screen: Clipboard with a checklist on it entitled “Hidden mandatory fees”, with the options “yes” or “no” on the checklist. The answer “no” is checked off.]

When you promote a product or service at a certain price, that advertised price must be attainable. 

In other words, the price you attach to your product or service in your marketing must be the price that your buyer ultimately pays. 

Don’t charge mandatory fees at the end of the purchase.

Price matters. A sale price, advertised as a savings in relation to a regular or “ordinary selling price” is especially compelling.

[Slide #15 on-screen: Image of a bullhorn as a symbol for marketing with the words “50%”, “Sale” and “New” coming out of it. Symbols of money around the bullhorn to further represent business, sales and marketing.]

When promoting a bargain or a “sale” on your products or services, it’s important that you don’t inflate your “regular” price to create a false bargain.

To comply with the law, the ”sale” price must based on the true regular price. 

A company must be able to validate the regular price by applying the “volume test” or the “time test.”

[Slide #16 on-screen: A graphic with two images. The first image is of people in a warehouse moving boxes of product inventory with the words “Volume Test” written on top. The second image is one of a person with a bullhorn who represents a marketer next to a clock with the words “Time Test” on top.]

To pass the volume test, your business must have sold a substantial volume of that particular product or service at the regular price or higher within a reasonable period of time.

To pass the time test, your business must have tried selling your product or service, in good faith, for a substantial period of time at the regular price or a price that is higher than your new “sale” price.

To avoid making deceptive claims about prices, keep these simple tips in mind

 [Slide #17 on-screen:  Image: Tag for a sale Text: Tips on sales]

Don’t use the words “sale” or “special” in your marketing collateral unless a true price reduction has occurred.

Don't run a ""sale"" for a long time or repeat it every week.

Don’t lure consumers with a bargain product that isn’t available and then offer a similar alternative at a higher price. 

Make sure that you have reasonable quantities of the product advertised at a bargain price before promoting a sale.

Don’t sell a product above your advertised price.

If two prices appear on your product or service, charge the lowest price.

[Slide #18 on-screen: Image of a businessperson assessing risk]

So far, you’ve learned that the Competition Bureau is responsible for addressing deceptive marketing practices. 

However, it also has responsibility for addressing different kinds of criminal misleading advertising that are similar to fraud.

The consequences of non-compliance with the Competition Act can be serious, 

including significant monetary penalties, restitution, prohibition orders and even imprisonment. 

One important step that businesses can take to minimize the risk of breaking the law is to put in place a corporate compliance program. 

Credible and effective measures can be as simple and nimble as your business. Plus, it’s the right thing to do.

"
52,Misleading,"this is not sustainable you might have noticed 
a trend amongst modern social media influencers  

they are getting incredibly rich just 10 years ago 
the very top youtubers on the platform were mostly  

filming out of their modest apartments doing 
average skits and living lives pretty similar to  

you or i almost all of them had regular day jobs 
and posted to the internet because they found it  

fun or at the very most because it could earn them 
a little extra side money contrast that with today  

where some influencers have the same reach 
notoriety and income as top athletes singers  

and movie stars as this new breed of celebrity 
has grown even wealthier they have been able  

to broadcast even more elaborate content 
whether it be showing off their new mansion  

giving away millions of dollars to strangers 
or simply spending more money on the production  

of their videos but this whole ecosystem is 
predicated on something of a marketing gold rush  

it is a unique and delicate blend of 
circumstances that made houses like this  

possible and that easy money situation is coming 
to an end faster than these people might expect  

so it's time to learn how money works to find out 
how the influence bubble will pop and what it will  

mean once it does in the late 2000s companies had 
a problem a key demographic for consumer goods  

people between the ages of 18 and 35 were becoming 
harder to place into neat little marketing buckets  

if you can't pin down the specific preferences 
of a group they are very hard to market towards  

and to make matters worse younger people 
were watching less television and listening  

to less radio which were at that point 
the foundation of consumer advertising  

you might think oh well 18 to 35 year olds don't 
have any money anyway so what's the problem well  

the problem is that while this group may have 
less income and wealth than older generations  

they spend more of what they have and they 
spend it more compulsively they do this because  

most of them are not yet burdened with financial 
responsibilities of raising a family of their own  

and are making their own money for the first time 
in their lives so accessing this demographic was  

hard but potentially very lucrative fortunately 
for the marketers around the world a new group of  

pseudo celebrity was being formed on micro blogs 
and the early video sharing sites of the internet  

these people were perfect for brands who wanted 
to tap into this difficult market of consumers  

the marketeers job was easy their consumer 
base was already compartmentalized by interest  

if you wanted to appeal to young mothers work 
with young mommy bloggers if you wanted to sell  

tools give a video mechanic a set for free 
to use on their new fancy youtube channel  

this all got even easier when companies like 
youtube introduced advertising features that  

allowed marketeers to bypass a direct relationship 
with the creator entirely and instead choose from  

a wide variety of parameters to show their ads 
using adsense and other similar offerings internet  

influencer marketing was also really cheap a large 
company could reach out to 100 million viewers for  

less than a hundred thousand dollars the same kind 
of exposure on commercial television would likely  

cost millions smaller companies could also get 
in on the action too the internet was not limited  

to a few large tv channels or radio stations so a 
small business could work with a small influencer  

to promote their product on a modest budget but 
all of these other benefits were insignificant  

compared to the greatest selling point of early 
influencer marketing people trusted influencers  

if a first-time parent is reading a mommy blog 
about how to get their children to stop crying  

they are already looking to that blogger for 
their wisdom on the subject of raising a baby  

if the blogger recommends a certain type of 
formula or stroller it is going to have a huge  

advantage over the competition because it is being 
recommended by someone that the parents trust the  

same trust extends to all influencers in any other 
specific niche a 2016 study found that twitter  

users trusted their favorite online influencers 
nearly as much as their close personal friends and  

that was twitter one can only reasonably imagine 
that the level of trust would be higher on a  

platform that is not a cesspool of people's brain 
farts so on the surface influencer marketing is  

a dream to companies it can be tailored to target 
specific audiences it is cheap and it is effective  

so why is this a bubble the first problem is that 
it's not that cheap anymore as more businesses  

rushed in to capitalize on the promises that 
influencer marketing offered the more competition  

there was for influencers at all levels some 
youtubers now charge over half a million dollars  

for an ad placement on a single video that is 
still slightly cheaper than commercial television  

for a similar number of views but not by much 
early on influencer marketing was dominated by  

small agile businesses that were willing to 
take the risk on a new form of advertising  

today large companies and businesses backed by 
endless amounts of capital dominate the space  

some businesses with enough investment backing 
don't even care if they spend more on advertising  

than they gain in revenue because their investors 
are primarily concerned with seeing business  

growth think about the brands who sponsor your 
favorite online influencer most of them are new  

companies with a lot of investor money backing 
them up the reason they spend so much money is  

because this marketing strategy can launch huge 
businesses practically overnight but it can  

also be incredibly risky i work as an investment 
banker in silicon valley so i am fortunate enough  

to have the direct exposure to market dynamics 
in the startup capital of the world let me tell  

you firsthand that the investment appetite for 
direct-to-consumer businesses is starting to wane  

the channel modern mba did a great video on these 
businesses so i will leave a link to his video  

below for anybody who is interested in learning 
more if these businesses fail to raise fundraising  

then they won't exist to pay millions of dollars 
every month to influencers across the internet  

for now it's hard to say if or when this will 
happen but with increasing interest rates and  

a slew of high profile business failures weighing 
on investors minds easy money might not be as easy  

to come by for the businesses which have been 
propping up the influencer bubble the cost of  

influencer marketing is insignificant compared to 
the bigger problem that these online celebrities  

are now facing people don't trust them anymore it 
should have been obvious from the start but a lot  

of influencers do not even care or understand what 
they are promoting if businesses can pay their fee  

they will get their recommendation i am now a 
youtuber and i can tell you from experience that  

the hardest part about working with sponsors is 
simply finding businesses that i feel comfortable  

promoting my good friend richard over at the 
plane bagel was once offered 30 thousand dollars  

to do just one video on a cryptocurrency richard 
obviously declined that offer because it was an  

obvious pump and dump scheme but many influencers 
wouldn't richard's channel has just over 500 000  

subscribers so one can only imagine how 
much these shady operations are offering  

people with audiences of millions of younger more 
impressionable viewers there have been countless  

scandals surrounding influencers that have been 
caught advertising to children promoting failed  

music festivals and pumping and dumping crypto 
projects over and over and over and over again  

young people are not dumb and they can see through 
influencers who are just saying something to make  

money without believing what they are promoting 
influencers that target young children can prey  

on the naivety of their audience for a little bit 
longer but audiences this young are going to need  

a parent to do their shopping and they are going 
to be harder to fool in a beautifully ironic twist  

the wealth that has been accumulated by top 
influencers over their careers is also eroding the  

trust that they once had with their audience ten 
years ago when a top influencer was talking about  

a product in their basic apartment it felt like 
they were talking to a peer or maybe even a friend  

now as david dobrik dances around his la mansion 
talking about sea geek he just comes across as a  

celebrity sponsor people like this struggle to 
genuinely recommend products because they are  

so wealthy and famous that they no longer need 
them do you think david needs to get his concert  

tickets on the resale market or do you think that 
he gets invited to these events before tickets  

even go on sale some of the savvier influencers 
will try very hard to convey an image of a normal  

lifestyle and maybe that's because they don't care 
for an ostentatious display of material wealth  

or maybe that's because that they know that it 
helps them better to connect with their audience  

the clear divide between an online friend and 
an online celebrity was only accelerated during  

early lockdowns this [ __ ] show coupled with 
the distasteful messaging of being hashtag in  

this together saw a rapid decline in the public's 
interest in influencer marketing now not only are  

consumers losing trust in influencers but so 
are businesses if a business uses an influencer  

as a spokesperson for their product they become 
inextricably linked to that person's reputation  

this can be a good thing if a brand wants to 
position itself as a fun loving product for young  

people it would do well by working with fun-loving 
young influencers but it can also go very wrong  

as well online influencers are far riskier to 
align with a brand than traditional celebrities  

traditional celebrities only really appear in 
carefully curated settings where their managers  

get to make sure they don't say anything out 
of line and even if they do it is likely to  

get cut out before being released to the public 
influencers on the other hand make their living  

by broadcasting their entire lives on the internet 
the good the bad and the ugly eventually something  

bad is bound to happen businesses also take on 
significant risk with influencers because of other  

businesses if an influencer takes on sponsorship 
from one brand that turns out to be fraudulent  

then logical questions will be raised as 
the legitimacy of all other businesses  

they promote so what does the future hold for our 
multi-millionaire influencer overlords well if the  

gold rush does come to an end they are all likely 
going to make a lot less money but that's probably  

a good thing the days of throwing money at online 
personalities and hoping for the best may come to  

an end but it doesn't mean that the practice is 
going away entirely instead it will hopefully  

mean that online marketing can become something 
better than a cheaper alternative to traditional  

celebrity endorsements on traditional media 
platforms there is nothing wrong with relatable  

people giving advice that they believe in about 
products that they understand and getting paid  

for it and the metrics will soon make companies 
realize that this is what made internet marketing  

great in the first place now if you want to see 
what a big fat hypocrite i am go and watch my  

video where i reveal how much money i made on this 
youtube channel after gaining 100 000 subscribers  

in less than a month thanks again for making 
it possible to keep on learning how money works

53,Misleading,"Hello, friends!

Stock Market Manipulation.

Insider Trading.

How do some people exploit the stock market?

What are the adverse effects of the stock market on a person and on society at large?

These are things that people rarely talk about.

But these are very common.

That's why in today's video on Finance,

come, let's see the dark side of the stock market.

Don't get me wrong.

Many of you might invest in the stock market,

I do it too,

so I'm not saying that the concept of the stock market is wrong,

but the things that I'll show you in this video,

will force you to think from a fresh perspective.

And you'd be able to make better decisions

when you invest your money in the stock market next time.

Come, let's see.

""Nifty is opening 70 points higher today.""

""Today, we have hit a new all-time high.""

""The Sensex has hit the 50,000 mark.""

""The market's in fine fettle as we speak.""

""Sensex has climbed the 60,000 peak.
It's highest ever.""

""But are you, like me, wondering

how is the stock market constantly soaring,

when the economy is actually going down?""

""So this is fickle money.

This is money that can go out once again.""

What is the need to have a stock market?

Why do stock markets exist?

What would happen if stock markets ceased to exist?

There is a simple reason for it.

Large companies need huge amounts of money for big projects.

An amount of money that no individual owns singlehandedly. 

So, through the stock market,

people can invest their money in the companies,

so that the companies get the funding for major projects

and for new innovations.

And in exchange for that, people get a share in the company's ownership.

It means that when the company earns good profit in the future,

you can get a part of it too.

But if the company incurs a loss,

you have to bear the risk.

This is the basic funda behind the workings of the stock market.

But if you look at the stock market from the perspective of a common individual,

a common investor looking to invest in the stock market,

Suppose, you are an investor that wants to invest in the stock market.

And you have the option of hundreds of companies.

In which company would you invest your money?

What would you consider before investing?

You'd ask which company would give you the most profit. 

For the money that you'd invest,

which company would give you the highest return on investment?

Which company would you bet on in this gamble?

If I tell you that I have the secret information about this Company X,

that this company would soon get a big funding

due to which, its stock price would increase rapidly in the future,

so you should invest your money in this Company X.

And if I give this secret information to you only,

wouldn't this gamble be unfair for the rest of the people?

Because they don't have this secret information

that the stock price of this company will soon go up.

Friends, this is the game of insider trading.

Generally speaking, Insider Trading means

making a profit by using such information,

that is not available to the public.

This 'Insider information' can be leaked by any insider

whether they are the employees of the company,

or an executive of the company,

or the accountant of the company,

if they use this information to invest in the stock market,

then it would be unfair.

It would be Insider Trading.

And if they tell this information to a friend or an outsider that is not a part of the company,

even then it would be termed Insider Trading.

But it is not illegal to reveal this insider information in all cases.

Let's take the example of a journalist.

If a journalist is carrying out an investigation,

and for that, he is analysing the insider information of the company,

the earnings data or the profit data,
that aren't publicly available, 

it is legal to do so.

Because the journalist is looking at the insider information only for his story as is his job.

But if the journalist, during the course of his investigation, comes across the information that

such and such accounts of the company are managed in a way that

it can be reasonably predicted that the stock price of the company would go up or go down,

and the journalist uses the information to earn a profit,

then it would be Insider Trading.

Now you'd wonder friends,

who's checking if your friend is working in a company

and he tells you the insider information secretly,

and you use it to make a profit without anyone knowing.

True, it is quite difficult to track these things.

And for this reason, friends,

stock market manipulation like this is very common.

Not only in India but in the rest of the world as well.

In fact, not only this,

to prove this type of stock market manipulation,

that a crime has been committed,

is extremely difficult.

Because there is a lot of grey area in between.

Suppose you say that

you got the information from someone else while travelling on the bus

when they were talking to each other,

that you didn't try to get this information,
you merely overheard someone else,

then it isn't illegal to overhear the information.

If a large company does such things,

then think how unfair it would be for the common investors.

Let me use a real-life example to explain this.

Goldman Sachs' alleged Aluminum Scam.

""The New York Times reporting over the weekend that

Goldman Sachs is running a scheme

to artificially inflate aluminium prices""

""An aluminium warehouse controlled by Goldman Sachs

holds the equivalent of a quarter of the annual North American demand for the metal

but only offloads or distributes a required minimum of 3,000 tonnes a day.

No more, no less.

Whatever the demand.""

What happened is that a branch of this bank is involved in aluminium production,

and they controlled the supply of aluminium in such a way

that the demand for aluminium keeps on increasing

and so does the price.

And then the invest in the Aluminium Futures,

because they basically can predict the future prices of aluminium.

This was about how insiders can illegally exploit the stock market.

But now let's look at

the decisions of common investors in the stock market

and their negative consequences.

Think about it.

If you go to invest money in the stock market,

what do you think about?

Primarily, most of you

think of profits only.

This means that the rest of the aspects are merely ignored.

Whether the company is doing good work,

whether the ecosystem of the company is good or not,

whether the impact of the company on the world is good or bad,

these things are completely forgotten by most people.

I'll use an example.

Suppose a company engages in cost-cutting practices

and cuts down on the employees' salary,

or fires some employees,

and the other employees are working at exploitative salaries,

doing so is good for the profits of the company,

more money saved by the company

means more profits.

And the investors of the company

see only the profits.

So they'd consider the practices good for them.

And they'd want it to happen.

This would give encouragement to 
the company

to treat their employees worse.

Or to pay them little.

Similarly, if a company is harming the environment,

suppose it uses harmful chemicals to produce its products

because it is cost-effective to do so,

enabling the company to gain more profit.

Or they release their chemical exhaust into our rivers.

Because processing the chemicals is expensive,

leading to lesser profit.

Or they literally dump garbage around us,

because it is expensive to process the garbage.

That is allowed within the legal limits.

These are detrimental to the world.

But the people investing in the company, blinded by the profits,

wouldn't realise these things

because they want their return on investment.

And this leads to a major negative consequence.

The effect does it have on the end consumer

shouldn't be forgotten either.

Because if the companies focus only on profits,

they are encouraged

to make greed-based products

instead of need-based products.

For instance, your breakfast.

Often companies market their products as something that you need to have with milk,

but actually its 70% sugar,

or the sugary cereals that you should eat in the mornings,

because everyone eats it.

This impacts your health

and obviously, the company ends up making a profit.

But if you eat home-made food for breakfast like milk, lassi or porridge,

no company would make a profit out of it.

And neither would any shareholder get a return out of it.

So often people, knowingly or not,

end up encouraging these things while investing their money.

The simple solution to this is that

thinks before you invest in the stock market

about the company, you're considering investing in.

How are the products of the company?

What is the impact of the company on our environment, our society,

and on people, in general.

Keep these things in mind.

The next problem is related to this.

Most people investing in the stock market,

run after the herd mentality.

They don't check the performance of the company themselves,

the closing statements of the company,

what the company actually does,

they simply see that their friend has recommended investing in that company,

or the company is discussed in the news

and all the investors are talking about the company

so they too should go ahead and invest in the company.

How is the buzz surrounding the company?

It matters way more than

the actual situation of the company.

And there is a really simple reason behind doing so.

The more people invest in the company,

would drive up the share price of the company.

And the return on your investment is also increased.

So in a sense,

the stock market is like fashion.

What happens with fashion?

I'd like to wear the clothes that others around me are wearing.

That's the trend today.

It's the same in the stock market.

I'd buy those stocks that are purchased by the others.

And if the others are selling a stock, I'd also sell it.

Consequently, the stock price or the share price of the companies

doesn't always depend on their performance

instead, it depends upon the company image in the market.

And the image can be built up and taken down quite easily

by using PR machinery

and advertisements.

By employing paid news and brand ambassadors.

All of these have a psychological impact

that can eventually influence the stock price of the company.

Imagine I bought a lot of stock in a small company at a low price.

And then, I go and pay news channels and print ads,

employ PR machinery and run trends on Twitter

that this company is about to get huge.

Urging everyone to invest in it.

There's a lot of positive publicity,

because of this more people invest,

and the stock price of the company goes up.

I get a lot of profit and then I sell off my stocks.

Suddenly, the stock price of the company would crash

because I held majority shares or a significant amount of shares.

Friends, this is known as the 'Pump and Dump' Scheme.

First, pump the stock price into rising,

and because you own a major portion of the stock,

sell it off later.

Dump it and then its stock price would go down crashing.

Do you know what's interesting?

The same thing can be done in reverse as well.

Basically, you can bet on a company performing terribly in the future.

In such cases, you can buy Shorts,

if you think that a company is going to perform badly in the future,

and if this actually happens,

you can earn profits off of it.

But imagine this,

as I told you, Pump and Dump schemes are practised,

similarly, if you get a Troll army, 

or use paid media systematically

to malign a company,

to a level that the investors lose their trust in the company,

and its stock price crashes,

if you had invested in Shorts,

then you could earn profits from it.

This is known as Short and Distort.

Basically, it is the opposite of Pump and Dump.

And in a country like India,

where rumours and fake news on WhatsApp spread like wildfire,

you can imagine how easy it is to do so.

I'll give you a real-life example of this as well.

In September 2018,

the price of Infibeam Avenues' shares fell 73%

when rumours were spread over WhatsApp

about Corporate Governance issues in this company. 

Investor wealth of ₹92 billion,

was wiped in one day.

When the price of the share came crashing down.

This wasn't an indicator of the performance of the company.

But it did happen.

Why?

Because it is so easy to spread rumours

and people work as herd mentality in the stock market.

Pump and Dump
and Short and Distort,

are different from Insider Trading.

Because the criminal in Insider Trading

is an insider or someone that knows an insider.

They knowingly exploit price-sensitive information.

But in these cases,

in these cases, it is the collective public

that acts like a herd

and they think that they have an insider information 

when they see any false rumour over WhatsApp,

or come across any rumours in the news

and based on it, they take an action.

And overall, friends, there are so many ways to manipulate the aspects of the stock market

that it would take a 10-hour long video

if I start listing down all the ways.

For example, moles can be planted in a company.

To leak insider information to outsiders.

Media houses can be paid to defame a company.

A giant company can control the various aspects of its functioning

can control the supply of something

through which they can control the stock price

and they can invest themselves and earn profits out of it.

Now, mix all the problems and manipulations and look at the chaos it creates.

Imagine a company using stock manipulation tactics,

to earn its profits.

And since people are driven by profit-motive,

people invest in it.

And because people have a herd mentality,

since one person is investing in it, the others would want to as well.

Things worsen exponentially.

The company earns more profits,
the stock price goes up,

people invest more in the company.

And as long as people are unaware of the manipulation,

the company ultimately benefits from it.

And such things eventually create Stock Market Bubbles.

Shareholders, the people that have invested in the company,

have never visited the headquarters of the company.

They don't know much about the company,
about its performance,

But the on-ground situation of the company 

maybe really bad.

Often, there is corruption among the people in the company.

They execute a scam to rob people of their money.

And when such a bubble bursts

regarding a large company,

then the entire stock market crashes

and often it may even lead to an economic crisis.

The biggest example of it is the 2008 Economic Crisis.

It was created by the US Housing Bubble.

""National Association of Realtors have reported

the worst month-to-month drop in existing home sales

since they started keeping track in the late 90s.""

""Not in generations has Wall Street absorbed

the number of body blows it took today.""

""The American Financial System is rocked to its foundation

as top Wall Street institutions topple under a mountain of debt.""

After the 2008 Economic Crisis, people had raised their voices against Wall Street,

and had even protested.

People questioned how it could be that

the stock market is manipulated by these large companies in their favour

and it is the common investor that bears the losses.

On top of it, people found it irritating that

the government had bailed out these large companies and banks.

Even after all they had done.

Another interesting fact,

it is said that Bitcoin was invented just after this.

As a decentralised tool.

People were fed up with the government's central control over banks and the economy.

So it is said to be one of the major reasons

for making Bitcoin.

Bitcoin will not be controlled by any central bank or central agency.

It will always be a decentralised tool,

and will create an alternative financial system.

The negative aspects of the stock market that I listed out in this video,

most of them are valid for cryptocurrencies as well.

In cryptocurrencies as well, there have been several Pump and Dump schemes

where people hype up a random coin

keep a major share of it with them,

and when the price increases, they Dump it and walk away with all the profit.

Profit-motive and herd mentality are also evident in cryptocurrencies.

When people invest their money in it.

But one thing is certain,

there is little to no scope of things like insider trading in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin,

because it is a decentralised thing

it is not controlled by a central company.

So no central company can manipulate it in a way

that stock prices are manipulated.

Despite all these,

I wouldn't tell you to give up investing in the stock market.

It's not so.

I invest in it.

It's only that you should keep these things in mind.

You need to be conscious about these things

and you should know that these do happen.

And how you can avoid them.

Whether you're investing in cryptocurrency or in the stock market,

Remember one thing.

Don't ever take loans to invest.

You should either have the required amount

or a good enough savings balance,

to invest that money.

And if you don't have it, don't invest.

Because while investing in the stock market or cryptocurrencies,

this is the last and a major negative aspect.

Often people take loans to invest

lose the money and can't repay the loan,

the stock market crashes,

and then several people commit suicide because of it.

Apart from this, the points that I told you,

keep them in mind while investing.

I hope you found today's video to be informative.

54,Misleading,"Watch this video till the end. Maybe your lot of money will be saved. People saved lots of money. So what I'm trying to say. At present, the penny stock scam is going on in the market. Maybe you are not aware of the information. Innocent people are becoming its goat. I am informing you so that this does not happen to you. It was some time ago. My employee from my office comes and asks. How is this stock for investment? Now there are a lot of stocks that I haven't even heard of myself. I said I haven't heard of the stock Give me some time and l analyze and tell. After my analysis got done I called that person and ask him who has told him about this stock. he said Sir tell me, how are these stocks for investment? Well, Tell me who told you about this stock. So a few days ago a message came. It was written in the message that buys this stock. If there is a stock of ₹ 2 then it will reach 38. This target was given. I asked him clearly, how much money did you put in that stock. Says sir I have put ₹ 100000. I said how many days before? Says it was put 15 days ago. When I did the stock analysis, I told him, that in 15 days the stock is broken. Then you will be at a loss. That's when I came to you His ₹ 100000 was only 60000. This means the losses of 40000 were done. He asked me, what should I do? Asking me how is it for investment? Told me yes, it's broken in 1 days. but stock price moves up  It seems that the target is 38 now, so now we should put more money and buy you tell me sir what does your analysis say? I ask him have you seen the company's financials and what is the revenue of the company? He said I have not seen all this. How did you get so much confidence in just one tip? Tips come regularly and trading tips also come in it. Told about the stock, but I did not invest money in it. It was a share of ₹ 10 and became worth ₹ 16. Sir, I have seen people's money increasing, so I had put money into this. I was watching many times, this time I had put money in the tips. I said, now you have put the money. What do you want now? I feel I should buy more now. It has become cheaper now, right now we should buy more. Price can jump from here. I told him, do one thing today. I told him which is your loss of 40000. Forget it and take rs 60000 out. I'm telling you, it's not right for you. He says sir let's see, I will tell you. He thought that I was giving him the wrong advice. He felt like this. He has got firm news that if there is insider information, then the price will increase. he left from there and after a few days, I ask him again. What is going on with that stock?? Because I have seen That stock has fallen in price. He said sir now only rupees 18000 remains.₹100000 remains ₹ 18000. ok, still what is he feeling sir I think the price will increase? Still, he is so optimistic that the price will go up. I said, now tell me how many of 18000 will become 18000 will become 36000. Even if you will get double from here, you still have a loss. So what are you doing I again told him to take out rupees 18000 so I don't know what he did in the end and it is a personal thing everyone has their individual opinion. If someone in my office fell victim to this Penny Stocks scam, how many people are there in the world? Now I tell you what's going on. A message had come to the person in which 10 became 16 too. So why does this happen? Understand this carefully. Today's date data is easily available on the internet. In fact lot of people get SIM card data or credit card data. You know when you send a message, You will also find out about Bulk Message Service. It will cost you 10 paisa per message. It means you can send messages to 10 lakh people for Rs 1 lakh. Now understand how this scam runs. This penny stocks are very cheap and people buy them in large quantity. Suppose someone took millions of stocks. He bought in a large quantity. After that, you know that message can be sent to lakhs of people in 10 paise. they sent SMS to the people. Now I am saying that 10000 people out of 1000000 became their victims. If 10000 people start buying penny stocks. Somebody will put 10000 will put 20000. will also put 2000000. There are a lot of people in the market. Even if you can average ₹ 50000 here10000 people had put it. then, Crores of rupees were put in that penny stock. the penny stock will continue to run So he is not wrong in saying that he had got tips first and after that price of the stock will not run 100% but this is a half story. we call it Getting pumped. Now the reality is reality taken in a big quantity. He started selling from here. When he starts selling, the price of the stock also starts breaking down. The roller coaster will fall the speed as it went up. So this pump and dump are continuous rings in the market. The owners of the company on directors of the company don't need to be doing the same. Even the common man who has a lot of capital with him. He can take penny stocks to a very high level by investing his own money! For example, I the  penny stock is running at Rs.1 and someone had put 1 crore in it. It will be two from his investment. and He showed people the dream that the target is 48 or 50. People will feel that the stock of ₹ 2 will become ₹ 50. People Put some money, let's try it. People put crores of rupees by making an all amount. Even if those two start becoming three, then people start believing more. And if it becomes 10 then people think oh wow but and after that dump. Because there were no fundamentals there.There was no analysis. Just a big scam that is running in the market. Anyway, you must  have got messages from many people from somewhere or the other. Because all of your data gets leaked in the market.It's not like it just happened in my office. the audience must have got the message of tips. You must have also invested money and there would have been a loss in it. If this has happened to you, then tell me by commenting. People will feel that what I have told is not a story but is reality. Do comment if you have ever suffered in this way. Finally do share this video. It will continue in the market and nothing will happen by making just one video. Messages and tips will keep coming, and people would ask for investment. and ultimately people have to suffer. And if you invest properly. These are the people who call the stock market wrong. that we have invested in the market and we lost. You didn't invest money in your stock market, you gambled. You do not do this and you learn this in actuality. Invest money after doing fundamental analysis. Because rule number one of Warren Buffet is never lose money and rule number 2 look at rule number 1. Don't lose your money, man. That's why we are training you on this channel. If you are watching the the the the the do-follow if your watching it on YouTube do subscribe and press the bell icon. If there will be any such information in the coming time, then we will tell you? Till then share this video with all.It can be good for many people. A lot of money can be saved from this kind of advice so will see you in the next video if you are new to the stock market then there is a link to leading stock brokers you can open your Demat account through upstox or Angel one or ICICI direct apps and That too for free. so you can earn money through refer and earn right now so open your Demat account now and start earning money. we will see you in the next video till the time you go self-made.

55,Misleading,"There is a famous dialogue of scam 1992 web series that stock market is that thing, which can satisfy the need of money for whole country, which is true. But if that is true then from every 10 person who invest in stock market, why 7 people lose money? Today everyone praises stock market and keeps an image of it like, that you invest, earn and enjoy but the reality is something else. And the dark side of it is so bad that you cannot imagine. There are many scams in stock market which can take your lifetime savings in one go. But have you ever thought how all this things is happening too esaily? And if it is happening then why is no one stopping it and most importantly, what we can do on our personal level so that we don't get stuck in this types of things, So, if you want to be safe from any scam then you have to understand how scam works. You will see mainly this three things in stock market, 1st Stock manipulation. How is stock manipulation done? To understand this we have to understand that how stock market works. So basic stock market works like this whenever a company needs money, then that company takes money from General public. In return public gets that company's share. And whenever someone purchases company's share then they have 2 ways to earn profit. 1st capital gain. Assume you buy a stock on 100rs. and sell it in 200 rs. Then the remaining profit is your capital gain. In spite of this many do intraday too. Suppose today I bought some share, and when it's price increased today, then I sold it. In that too whatever gain you earn is your short term capital gain. And another way is dividends. Whenever a company makes profit then it has an option, that they can share some portion of the profit with their share holders, which is also called as dividends. Now, how a company's stock price go up or down? Well, there are 2 factors included in it. 1st Company's performance. That how is company performing? Is company in loss or profit? and 2nd demand and supply, which is mainly controlled by market greed and fear. Means if there is much greed in market then any stock price will hike up instantly. Why? because people demands stock very much but supply is less. And in same way if the supply is more but demand is not much then, that stock price will fall. Now, most important any stock's price, is manipulated how? There can be anything from these 2 in stock manipulation, 1st company fundamentals, means to manipulate in the company's financial figures, changed them, either showed too much profit or hide the losses. Or many times it happens that related party transactions are done in company. Means the company's promotors, transfer the money in their family members' account, and then convert them into cash and show fake bills of this transactions in company. Now if any company's fundamental is strong then the stock price of that company will increase. and if the fundamentals are weak then it will fall. And the 2nd way of manipulation is, is volume control, in simple words, the stock's trade volume is being manipulated, or controlled by you in some way. It further has 2 things. 1st, Institutional pumping, means the institutional investors buys any stock in bulk, or sell any stock in bulk. So, in this condition either the stock price will hike up or will fall. And 2nd, Retail pumping in which people like you and me, start buying or selling a particular stock. Now, How is the retail pumping done? Well, there is a old trick which is know as paid media. You give money to any big media house, And that media house starts saying good things about that particular stock. by which many will think to invest in that stock is good and that crores of people, will start investing in that particular stock. And the price of that stock, will hike up instantly. And this same thing can be done vice versa, give money to some media house, and start defaming a particular stock due to which people will start panic selling it, and it's stock price will fall. And 2nd convenient way is social media. You have noticed there are many WhatsApp groups, Instagram pages, where different kind of stock tips are given.  Different kind of information is given on different kind of stocks. Many of us, without confirming that information, starts buying or selling that particular stock. due to which this stock manipulation is normal too. Now, the 2nd most dangerous thing which is going on in market. which is stock market tips. But the question is why is it too dangerous? Today you can find some people on the street corner, some WhatsApp groups,  some telegram groups, and many agencies too who will tell you that, we will provide different kind of stock tips from which you will make profit guaranteed. And many in the greed of this join this groups. Now see how it works. In this groups you are not alone there are many like you.  Now whoever runs this group divides this group in equal audiences. for an example, some group has 10 lakh people in it. Then there will be 2 divisions of 5 lakh. Group A and Group B then what they do is they say Group A to sell a particular stock. And says to group B to buy that particular stock. Now 5 lakh people started selling that stock and another 5 started buying it. Now any one group will make loss and any one group will make good profit. Now the group which made profit is again then divided into 2 groups. So at first the total audience is of 10 lakhs, then group of 5-5 lakhs were made. after that only 5 lakh remained. Now this audience were further divided into 2.5 lakh group And again the same process was repeated. Now what will happen in this? The people will trust this platform, this particular group. And this is where the real game begins. Because you have made some good profit 2-3 times, So you have started trusting this group. That the tip we get, that tip is genuine, then this group will offer you some premium group or premium membership which is on 1 lakh, 2 lakh, 3 lakh or sometimes five lakh. And interestingly you buy this membership at once because you now trust it. That whatever money I will invest I am earning profit from it too.  So within 1 or 2 days whatever the money I invested, will easily return. And as soon as you give money to them then there will be a blast, Your number gets blocked. And there goes your money.  If you genuinely want to analyze that this groups are original or fake, then do your own technical analysis.  Analysis chart pattern and see for yourself that whether something is happening in actual or not? and there is one more way to catch these things. 99% of the groups, recommend the penny stocks, of which company's market capitalization is very less. which are not that much big of a company. Now it happens because to any penny stock, can be easily manipulation by 5-10 lakh people. But if there is some big company whose market cap is big, you won't be able to move it. hence in this kind of group you will mostly get penny stocks recommendation. And if something like it is happening then be alert then, Now all this is going on but in stock market one more thing is there which is the most, and the most easiest way, which is insider training. Which is illegal. Insider trading means, company's information which is not available in public domain, using that you are earning your profits and the irony is to catch that thing is tough. because in many cases you won't be able to find, that this information is sent where, and who used it, now insider trading is done 2 ways. 1st a short way, which is friends and family, you heard it from someone, some friend asked someone from your family that what is going on basis of that you did some trading, some investing, due to which you got profit. It is illegal but people do it. 2nd way is majorly operated on big scales which is known as moles. Many people plant some people in companies which give them information, by using which, they place trades and earn profits. If you have seen the Bazar movie, then the Shakun kothari in it, earns so much profit because he has moles in many companies. who brings information to him. Earlier there were no digital broker only normal brokers. who used to invest the money of others in any stock. then they make loss and then they used to say that stock market is gamble. Stock market makes losses, don't invest here. All the things I said happens a lot in stock market. someone takes your money by giving tip or someone by pump and dump. which is bear by normal people. In reality stock market is no gamble, but a good way for us to create a good wealth in long term. I know what you are thinking that from where should we learn about stock market?  well if you are a beginner, then for you what every Indian should know about investing. and if you want to move to a more advanced level, then coffee can investing for you. these 2 books are best. And yes if you want to save time and money then, you can listen the book's summary in your regional language on KukuFM. through which you will known more about stock market. and you will be able to take a smart investment decision. On kukuFM, thousands of audio books, many book summaries and many shows, are waiting for you in your regional language and yes, If you use my coupon code ADI 50, then on your yearly subscription of KukuFM, you will get 50% off. but this code which gives you 50% off, is valid for only first 250 users. Link is added in comment and description box. It is a limited offer choice is yours. Everyone want to be rich and millionaire today, and there is nothing wrong in it but the greed to get it quickly, due to which people get stuck in bad things. And honestly if you want to invest in stock market, then I would suggest you to do it. But in other's saying, by taking tip from anyone don't invest. If you want to invest then analyze the company properly. Understand how their business works, and then invest in the particular company. and if you invest in any company by properly thinking and analyzing then I can guarantee you one thing whether you make profit or not, but you will definitely get one thing that is you will understand, that how you analyze any business. And how business work. The biggest problem today is people want to invest in stock, and not in companies or their businesses.

56,Misleading,"I was being told for quite some time that to bring the next episode of Business Games. Until now I have in Business games I have analyzed the companies and I have brought out their hidden things. But today I thought that the industry in which I am for which you watch my videos. Stock Market Let me bring you the dirty secrets of the stock market. Let me expose it a little bit. So in today's Business game We will know about the dirty side of Stock Market. Blood Do you have blood? Yes, you heard me right. Do you have blood? If you have it then today it will boil. Because today I'm going to tell you such truths which are going to sting a lot. I am going to tell you how the stock market is sometimes manipulated. By some greedy thieves. Yes, I am calling them thieves. To call them operator it will be like I am giving them respect. So there are some thieves in the stock market. Whom we also call operator. How they of retail investor's hard-earned income steal them. And make millions. So today I am hoping that your blood will boil and you know for making this video there are two reasons. First if you know what is going on. Then you can see when it happens to you and you can avoid falling into it. And second you know we Youtubers all the Youtubers no matter what kind of video they make. We make a lot of money. We get many ads, many sponsorships we receive people's love. So we get a lot of fame also a lot of money. In return, at least I always think that what am I doing in return? Am I just going towards making money. Am I really giving you that value giving you that information which I should give you that you expect of me. Am I being able to do that? So for the past few days, I was  honestly feeling that I need to step-up I need more to tell you more about this  industries truths. And It is a step toward that direction. Because I have received so much love I got everything because of you. So the filth that goes on in the industry to openly talk about it must be done without without the shame that what  will others think about it. Because the things I'm going to tell many influences also do those things. So many times it seems that that they will angry mad or they  will get angry. But then comes attention that they didn't make me. You guys have made me. So how can I betray you. So today I will speak openly. And when I speak openly then blood will boil. Today I will tell you that how some stock market thieves Manipulates this market normal and common investors like you gets stuck in this market. This is Pranjal Kamra let's start Finology Now whenever it comes to manipulators and operators then the first question which is asked is on SEBI. What is SEBI doing? It's very easy right say whatever wrong that happened with us what is SEBI doing? Tag SEBI on Twitter and hope that they solve every problem. But we also have some responsibility. That we at least the simple ways we must keep them in mind and no one can easily cheat us. It is easy to blame any authority. But the truth is that today there are 1000-1100 people at SEBI. They have to track 5000 companies Mutual Funds, PMAS. Investment Advisors Mutual Funds distributors they have to regulate them all. Because I today am going to tell about other people that what they do wrong. So it will start when I tell this that what you and I do wrong? Like I have also seen one more mistake. Any IPO we take that was our decision let that be Paytm or any other IPO. We wanted to have all the big listing gains. I have made many videos on IPO I have told why you should  stay away from it. You are seeing it on the card and description. Despite of that when we take an IPO and we make a loss from it. So many times I have seen that we tag SEBI. Or we tag who recommended it. And we say that they have cheated us. So this I find a little wrong. SEBI can do nothing here. Everyone, like you, are free to pick which shares to take, which  share not to take. Just like that any company is free to select the price for its IPO. If you are ready to give that price. When we sell our land if we sell it at a high price. Then no one can say that why did you sell your Rs-1 crore land for Rs-1.2 crore? Give back the Rs-20 lakhs, you are a fraud. No We are buying what thing for what price is our responsibility. So this I think that I should say. When we badmouth others then we also need to accept  our badmouthing. That what mistakes do we make. Now I am going to tell you that in the Share market what sorts of manipulations happen. Here I want to talk about SEBI. Many times we have said bad about them but one thing is also true that in the past 30 years since SEBI came. They have worked continuously that manipulation can be reduced Retail investor's interest can be saved. And no one can be 100% full proof. But SEBI is going in the right direction A lot of malpractice they have to curb it. So we sometimes blame it. But sometimes forget saying thank you to SEBI. So today I will also do a tweet tagging SEBI on it I will say ""Thank you SEBI"". And I am requesting you to Retweet that tweet also with this hashtag ""Thank you SEBI"". And we will also tell them a little too that we are appreciating their hard work recognizing it. And we are not here just to criticize them. Come let's start today's topic. First way the game of good news and bad news. Now think that I'm the company's owner. I have 40% shares of that company and I want to increase the shareholding. I want to buy 5% more shares of my company I want to make my shareholding 45%. But now I am finding the shares expensive So what will I do? Many media houses are very good they work very responsibly. Some journalist some media houses like in every profession not everyone is good and not everyone is bad. Some are good and some are bad. Also in media Some are good and some are bad. Everyone has their compulsions. So I as a company owner I will tell any such media house or any such journalist that Please take this money and fake news is to be published  about the company that there is a fight going on between the company's CEO and CFO. And it can happen that anyone  of them resigns. So doubt is coming towards the company's future. This is what we have come to know  from the sources. And if this publishes on any major news website which people read or comes on the TV. Then what will happen? The investors will get scared the share price will come down and this is what I was waiting for. I will buy my shares I will increase my shareholding. The share has fallen and now  I am able to buy them at cheaper prices. After 2 days CFO and CEO will issue a clarification that there is nothing like this this is all market rumor these are speculations. And you don't pay attention to all of this nothing is of this sort. But in those 2 days they did well as much regulation is allowed there is also a limit on the regulation. But as much regulation that's allowed in a very very good way they bought the shares and as the news was published by sources so no one can say that Why did you spread this news? or why did someone spread this? They were secret sources. After 2 days be clear and deny that there is nothing like that. And bought shares cheaply for 2 good days. So this cycle of good news and bad news. When it's time to sell then turn on some good news. When it's time to buy turn on some bad news. And every time by manipulating your own shares keep on earning by buying and selling them. This happens a lot in this industry. And it's very easy to see it. Go to that company's news section like in our Ticker you will find news about any company at it's page. And see what type of news comes out. Does every time news comes out like this on the 1st date, a rumor came on the 3rd date, it was denied. So from 1 to 3 you go and see the pricing section that is what happened to the share price. You will understand that how is the management and can you trust that management or not. Second defaming super investors. Those investors whom we follow misusing their names. I don't quite remember I roughly remember it, it was many years ago It was many years ago I think maybe it was about 7-8 years ago. Suddenly about a bad looking company it was flashed on the TV news channel that Rakesh Jhunjhunwala invested in this stock. And some big panel were set that this stock is not looking good. But if Rakesh Jhunjhunwala Sir  has invested in it then something must be good. And things like that. And it was a Micro cap share the upper circuit was put on it. Very good for 1-2 days it increased very well. After 2 days clarification comes that this is not that Rakesh Jhunjhunwala what we were thinking. This is some other Rakesh Jhunjhunwala in some other city. He has bought 1% shareholding in it and the market thought that he is that great investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala. It's not like that he is someone else. And suddenly all small investors, who have in the TV news have trusted that share by  seeing that name. They will feel cheated any of the next few days the lower circuit was put on that share. So I don't quite remember the name it was a long time ago but I know that something like this happened. Misusing a super investor's name. We have made a solution for this so that you don’t have to get stuck  in these rumors. You go to Ticker go to the super investor section there you will find verified investments. Which investor is invested in which stock you choose the investor's name. Which stocks have they invested it you will see the full list. So this type of manipulation cannot happen with you. Third, it's very unique you haven't heard it before Name Lending. Meaning everyone knows that we invest by seeing super investors that where are they investing. Companies also know about this. So most of the people are very good. But again everyone is not good in every field. So there are some people, I don't know  who they are but I've heard that this type of things happens. That I know if XYZ investor if it comes that this man has  invested in my company so my company's share will increase. Then I will go to that investor I will tell them I know my company is bad. But you please invest 1% in it. Take 1% of its shares so a disclosure comes to the stock market and let the public know. Now think that my company is of Rs-100 crore. So to take 1% stake the investor has to invest Rs-1 crore. They will say, ""Why should I invest?"" It's such a bad company, I don't  want to invest. Company will say No problem you have to invest Rs-1 crore right? You do it in white from your bank account why don't we send you Rs-2 crore in cash. So your investment became free on top of that we are giving you Rs-1 crore more so that your name can be seen in the stock market that you have invested in our company. By seeing that that Rs-100 crore company their share will increase by 50% it will become Rs-150 crore. You can sell it, we will also sell it. We have made a good Rs-50 crore. The public can go to hell what have we got to do with it? So this is called Name lending. Where just for the name some investor is investing in that company. So that people can see their name they get attracted and invest in that company. Fourth way to leak some so called insider information  about a company. We are very straightforward people right we get excited that Hey do you know that I got an accurate inside news this company is getting a new tender and its revenue will be doubled. We don't think that if that news has come true who are we? We have just started to invest in the market and we just invested some thousands or some lakes. And all of a sudden we got  this much access that we are getting insider news. This is our illusion, we are straightforward. If that news has reached to us no matter it came from how  much reliable source no matter whether it came from your closest friend relatives or you got from anyone. That news is being delivered to you and your friend is not wrong that news is also being delivered to him. To you people definitely these operators, these thieves what's to dump that share and get themselves out. So never trade on any so called insider information. One this is illegal and second, if it's reaching you then definitely it is being delivered to trap you. Don't trust it. Fifth, we all have heard its name but its way has changed. Pump and Dump Create a lot of hype for a stock. It's a very good company this will happen in it that will happen in it. This company is going to change India. This company is for India. Sometimes present a very nationalistic picture and many more, first what would happen print them in the magazines try to publish it on TV channels. These days Influencers Influencers in every platform. So when you are seeing that suddenly about an unknown company which no one knew before. 7, 8, 10 influencers are tweeting about it or making a reel on Insta making shorts or reels on YouTube. And no one knew that company till today. Suddenly together everyone remembered that company and also in the messages there are similar words similar message. So first you don't have to believe anything from that tweet or video. Second if you can then you also need to stay away from that influencer. umm... I am not going to take anyone's name all of you umm... can see this, it happens a lot. But it's a very sad thing. Some big big influencers maybe their monthly income is in the lakhs are for sure. Maybe their monthly income can be  in the millions. They also do things like this. So... it hurts a lot when this happens. And but you know I'm sure now when I have told you this then you will see those things. You will observe them carefully and you need to stay away from these things. In fact, you know when we  pick stocks in Recipe under Finology One you also get Recipe's subscription where we give more than 15 stock recommendations. So from the first few checks there is one check that Is all of this happening in that company? Is any price manipulation going on there? How are their promoters? Are they reliable? Is something illegal happening there? We are not successful every time but our first focus for picking stocks  in Recipe is that if you are going for our recommendations so to save you from these companies. Business model, Valuation comes later first of all that company or people connected with that company cannot be thieves. And nowadays the number of thieves is increasing a lot. So in Recipe we try to stay away from stocks like these. Recipe and Finology One's subscription link are in the above card and are in this video's description. Like I said it's the first step but if you want to learn stock picking  by yourself. What are our steps to pick a stock.

So today I told about stocks. For some time now Mutual Funds are also in the news a lot. Just as all this many more wrong things It also, happen in Mutual Funds. So in the next video I will be bringing in Business Games That, what wrong things happen  in Mutual Funds. May you also know its truths because all of us every time, even me have praised Mutual Funds a lot. But praising like this is not right that is like showing you half of the picture.

57,Misleading,"Well, Do you want to be rich? You have so much money that you have to think about what we will do with that money. Well, you are not alone in India. Many people see such dreams. But when they see such dreams, they do not work hard to fulfill those dreams. They don't have a thing called patience. What do they start doing? They start looking for shortcuts and then feel that the Stock market is one such way by which we can get rich very fast. Well, It happens to people that some people get rich very fast. But most people don't get rich very fast, it takes time. But now because people think of the stock market as a place where we will come and gamble and make money. Now for this gamble, they need tips that we get tips from somewhere and we invest our money on that tip and that our money gets multiplied and the people who are giving tips from here, they start the biggest scam of the stock market of India or all over the world. Now how is this the world's largest scam, I will tell you this. But now imagine it, Suppose Today you have a thousand rupees. Today you invest somewhere and tomorrow it becomes ₹2000 because someone gave you a very powerful and 100% correct tip. You think you will earn, Now you reinvest that ₹2000 and you get a perfect tip and that money becomes ₹4000. Now you tried that tip twice, that tip is working 100 percent, now next time from where you get the tip, you use it again. And what happens, your money becomes ₹ 8000. Now imagine, if this tip is working thrice, how much money will you invest next time. You will think that if this tip is working every time, so I have already earned ₹8000, so this time I'll invest ₹50000. Now when you put ₹ 50000, it becomes ₹100000, Now your dreams wake up. Your dreams wake up that now I will become very rich because all these tips are working. And I will also tell you in this video why I do not give you tips. I'll tell you now, these tips are working effectively as much and all are going well. Does it happen that, on today's date there are many such YouTube channels, There are many such groups and many such telegram groups, where people say that we give you tips and we give you daily tips which are not even 99%, which is 100% correct? This means whatever we will say, it will happen, but we will give you tips for only 3 or 7 days. We, Will, give 3 to 7 days tips free and you follow these tips if you think that we have given you correct tips, after that, you give us money for tips. You give us ₹ 50000 together for 1 year of the whole year or you give us one lakh rupees Now I think if someone has benefits in Lakhs, then he can give 50k or one lakh. He will say that I will give it very comfortably. If I can earn ₹ 100000 by investing 50,000 then why can't I give ₹ 50000 to some other person? But just think about the person who is giving the tip. If he knows the tips so effectively then why doesn't he invest his own money because I come on the previous example? Here a guy starts from ₹ 1000. Suppose what I said next that he will invest ₹ 50000 or one lakh. He doesn't invest, he just earns 1K to 2K and 8K. Tell me in the comments, how much money he will have after 30 days. What money he will have in 30 days, if he starts with 1000, tell me in the comments. Now my question is that if a person knows the tips so effectively then why is he taking money from anyone, he should invest his own money. Why are we giving tips to others? If we can multiply our own money, now a game starts from here, which most of you do not know and most of the people from you are going to be trapped through these tips. Look, you are investing in the stock market, but if you want to earn money quickly, then you will go towards the shortcut. If not today then tomorrow you will go and you will get stuck in a shortcut, so before you get stuck, explain something to you today. A huge game, there is a huge scam going on, as I said. Now, what happened, a person gets the data. Where did he get the data now, from the brokers? What are these brokers now? Just understand carefully. As I suggested to you open your Demat account. I have suggested you open it on upstox, which is secured and safe. But many brokers are not safe and secure, they leak the data. So open your Demat account with a securities broker. If you want a secure broker, then I will suggest you because I have my own Demat and trading account on upstox, so you get to open your trading account on upstox. So you now have the link in the description and comment box. If you open a Demat and trading account on upstox, then you are getting free digital gold, then it is a good company. But there are also very small companies, and broker firms that open your Demat account but leak the data. That's why data is very important. Now I have suggested to you that you have to secure your data, then go on the right platform. Many people suggest you, whose name you have not even heard of, opening an account with that broker. Don't be greedy here. Now that the broker leaked the data, Now the game starts from here. Suppose it leaked the data of one lakh people, they have data of one lakh people, who do trading and they leaked data of one lakh or some person made a telegram group and said that here we give free tips, we give share market tips for free. Now if you go to the telegram channels on the Telegram, you will get lakhs of people on Telegram. There are telegram groups of lakhs of people, but how much money do they take to make this group, zero. Now the game starts from here, see, we had data of one lakh people. Now we will divide one lakh people, into two groups, the first group of 50000 and the second group of 50000, now there can be two things in a share, either it will increase or it will go down. One of the two things will happen, either it will increase or either it will go down. So, We tell these 50000 people that you people buy the shares of that ABC company, and we tell the other group that you sell the shares of ABC company, then by evening only two things will happen: either that share will increase and or share will fall. Now let's assume that today that share has increased, then now that person has forgotten these 50 thousand people, he doesn't care for these 50 thousand people, now he does on the next day because I told you that tips are needed for 3 to 7 days, then he will work in this way, he made a group of 25000 people and made a group of 25000 people then again said that you buy the shares of XYZ company and here you were told to sell the shares of XYZ company. Now let's assume that the stock went down today, said to Buy it, but the people who have lost it, they went to hell, they don't matter. Now come on these 25000 people, Those who sell, have profits. Now, what do they do the next day? In 25,000 people, a group of 12500 people and a group of 12500 people, they will say that you buy a stock, Suppose there is a share of MVP company, and you buy it. And there is a share of MVP company, you sell it. Now the stock rose on this day. Now, these 12500 people have told you that it has been 3 days for you guys. You guys have been following our tips for 3 days, not more now. you have taken a lot of free tips. Now you give us money, now these 12500 people, they said that it is amazing. We are getting tips every day with 100% accuracy. If he is telling us to buy, then we are enjoying it and if he is speaking to the seller, we are enjoying it by selling it. Money will grow. Now they take their money from you. They take any money, there are little people and there are big people in India. So There is no cost here in India for how much money they will take from you and when you give money, then you will get tips. But what will happen, 50% of tips will be fine and 50% of tips will be wrong. But these people do not guarantee this. They will be 50% okay or 50% can be wrong, it may be 60:40 sometimes, I do not say that all the people who give tips are wrong. But if there is a company that is doing good analysis and is doing well, it is watching. It is analyzing the company's fundamentals, it is doing technical analysis. And they have a lot of information to analyze. So if you are getting tips from good sources, then it makes sense. But in this way, there are many such places on social media like YouTube and telegram. where they attract you in the name of tips and then you will not even understand. You will also feel that a hundred percent right is going but the game is going on inside, where did the game start, you do not know, most people are not understanding this game. Now the new people who are coming to invest in the stock market, they are not understanding this game. But you got it. What I always tell you is to do value investing. Don't run after tips, that's why I don't give Tips. Now let's take it as an example. Suppose I analyzed a share by myself and that share is performing well, now suppose you buy it for 100 and it will go on 150, you will say it is awesome Pushkar, Everything is best. But in the next month, it fell and became 75. Now you will abuse me that you told me and now share fall. But because you have no patience, That's why you will do this, because I know that what I said for ₹ 100, I didn't say it seeing that it will become 150. I was looking long-term. I was looking for 5 years and if I look for 5 years and the share goes to 4000. But, you saw that it is going down, let's say it came to ₹ 55 after ₹ 75. Now you said that I will not do any more loss. I want to sell it here. You sold here, you said that Pushkar told us and we booked the loss. Pushkar has held it here and his ₹ 100 becomes ₹ 4000. It wasn't that my tips were wrong. The thing is because I am a long-term Investor. I am not trading for the short term. I am carrying a long-term vision. Hence what I am doing maybe it will benefit me in the future and can also make a loss. But to give you  tips or not, is a very important thing. If you just think to yourself that if you are running after tips that someone just tells me today, what is going to happen tomorrow. It's not even Warren Buffet knows what's going to happen tomorrow in the stock market. No one knows what is going to happen tomorrow. If anyone would know as I told you if anyone knows then where can he go in 30 days from thousand rupees, so think, nobody knows and if anyone knows then I feel that then investors should move away in share market and retailers should move away, and the astrologers should come because they will give you a better suggestion. That the planetary constellations of this company are looking good. Invest in it, no need to see P/E Ratio. It doesn't matter what intrinsic value, which company gives a dividend or not, What difference it makes, just today it seems that it will go up. I'm telling the truth. I have seen a lot of people who are connecting business and astrology here, there are so many people. I have seen some videos, today is Tuesday, and this Stock will go grow. Wow, what a decision you have taken. But this scene of Tuesday doesn't work in the US, it should also work there. Now you better know, which I wanted to explain to you today. Do you understand that you have to understand not to run behind tips? If you will run after tips, you will harm yourself and I want you not to harm yourself, then I came to you with these short videos. I think I have given you that important information which is of most use to you and what did you understand. Tell me by commenting below and sharing this video because the people who are running behind tips, should not be harmed. If you are watching this video on youtube then subscribe and click on notification Bell and if you are watching on Facebook then you just follow now I will see the next video till the time you go self-made.

58,Misleading,"[Music]

elizabeth holmes built her entire

theranos empire around a product that

was supposed to solve one of the biggest

hurdles in healthcare

access to affordable blood testing

with her revolutionary edison machine a

single drop of blood would be able to

run up to 240 tests from albumin to

white blood cell count and everything in

between it was going to change health

care as we knew it our work is in

[Music]

the belief that access to health

information is a basic human right by

2015 forbes named holmes the youngest

and wealthiest self-made billionaire in

the u.s until we put elizabeth on our

cover just a few months back i hadn't

heard of you i hadn't heard of the

company and yet your company is valued

at over 9 billion but there was a catch

behind closed doors the edison machine

simply didn't work nearly as well as

promised and theranos was essentially a

sham but with hundreds of millions of

dollars in funding theronos allegedly

continued to persuade investors into

believing in their cause and the

investments kept coming

venture capital funded companies are

nothing new for silicon valley in many

ways investors have become one of the

most important parts of the entire

startup ecosystem when i'm an investor

in a startup i assume that 60 of them

are going to go out of business the

question is why did investors embrace a

startup like theranos which built its

entire empire around a product that

didn't work and now with elizabeth

holmes on trial for allegedly lying to

them why do so few of them seem mad

about it there is a great technology and

it's going to happen and she will have

had a huge hand in making that happen

having grand ambitions isn't a crime

startups often present some pretty wild

ideas this will enable the creation of a

luna base

but if a company allegedly uses

deceptive practices in order to raise

hundreds of millions of dollars well

that's a different story and why

elizabeth holmes is on trial for

numerous charges related to wire fraud

it's very rare that we see the ceo of a

company facing criminal charges much

less the founder of a startup russell

brandom is policy editor at the verge

he's been following the holmes trial

since the beginning a lot of the charges

here are wire fraud because

they wired the money so if they had

mailed cash it would be mail fraud

most of them are wire fraud against

investors allegedly she said things that

weren't true and then

based on those lies she was raising

money and that's fraud

in 2015 the wall street journal

published a slew of articles revealing

multiple levels of deceptive practices

theronos allegedly covered up these

practices while continuing to coax money

from wealthy investors and the list is

impressive

media mogul rupert murdoch general jim

mattis who also served on the thermos

board and even the walton family you

know the richest family in the world so

because of that culture of venture

capital investors always always defend

their companies and you see even after

a lot of the reporting has come out

saying look these machines are not

working

something doesn't smell right here a lot

of investors were still defending

elizabeth holmes saying oh she's the

next steve jobs you're just trying to

take down a sort of visionary founder

are you willing to admit that you were

wrong about this one absolutely not

i i feel that we have taken down another

great icon i think really it's just

they want to give everything as much

runway as possible and they figure look

either things will work out and then

i'll get rich and look like a genius or

it won't and it's not really my problem

for most of the theranost investors the

amount of money lost pales in comparison

to their net worth and while some were

able to clawback their investment many

simply lost it all

you know is the victim here rupert

murdoch i don't know i don't feel that

much sympathy form i don't think this

meaningfully affected rupert murdoch's

net worth like no one is sleeping on the

street tonight because they invested in

theranos it was a really bad time for

the employees but they're not really

sort of represented here it was a really

bad time for some patients who got bad

medical results it is odd that the

investors are at the center of the trial

when they're kind of the least

sympathetic players here

this obviously doesn't justify the fraud

that allegedly took place behind the

scenes at theranos but it does point to

a larger pattern of behavior in silicon

valley that has become somewhat

problematic

investors blindly tossing huge sums of

money behind overheated companies that

in reality only have a small chance of

succeeding in the first place if you

really researched what holmes was

promising it didn't add up

testimony from the trial has revealed

that many investors failed to exercise

due diligence before handing over

millions in funding to theranos many

barely knew anything about the

healthcare industry at all

you got people who were sort of very

prestigious and very important

but maybe not

rigorous enough to really check

what was being claimed success builds

more success so you hear oh rupert

murdoch invested in this company well he

must have done his his research well why

did rupert murdoch invest well he heard

that the army was using it none of these

were people who were really experienced

in

the blood testing world and when you got

someone like that who was you know bill

gates famously looked at their

technology and he has a lot of money

he's interested in investing in things

but he has this larger background in

looking at okay what are the medical

interventions what can we what can we be

looking at he was like this doesn't make

any sense no one could test that much

from from a drop of blood and the things

they're saying about how they're doing

it don't add up

ultimately what may have led theranos to

use allegedly deceptive tactics was the

momentum from the investors themselves

who wanted so badly to turn a profit

that they ultimately couldn't see

through all the hype

i think people are very very angry at

elizabeth holmes i think you have people

who

are mad at

you know maybe the media that enable

terps or

if you wrote an article saying oh this

is this visionary genius you sort of

feel like a bit of a doofus but like

even now i don't think the people who

invested in theranos and like enabled

all of this are seeing any real

consequences from it

you

"
59,Misleading,"hey what's going on everyone thanks for checking 
out this video my name is travis from master to  

market and i wanted to make this quick video to 
talk a little bit about why i don't think penny  

stocks make good long-term investments and this 
may come as a bit of a surprise because on this  

channel i talk a lot about how i day trade penny 
stocks but it's important to keep in mind that  

short-term trading such as day trading and even 
swing trading are much different from long-term  

investing and in this video i'm going to go over 
five reasons why penny stocks are generally not  

going to make good long-term investments and 
why you're going to probably have better luck  

by looking into more reliable companies and more 
reliable stocks for your long-term investments  

and the first of those five reasons is that penny 
stocks are going to most often be in long-term  

downtrends and when you think about a trend in 
the market whether it be an uptrend or a downtrend  

it's always going to be in your best interest to 
go with the trend rather than trying to fight the  

trend and if a stock is in a downtrend you're 
going to be fighting that trend by trying to  

buy into that stock and trying to predict the 
exact bottom of the move the same is true for  

a stock that's in an uptrend if it's up trending 
the way that you would ride that momentum and take  

advantage of that momentum is by buying into 
the stock and by trying to short sell it and  

predict the exact top of the move in that case you 
would be fighting the trend of an uptrending stock  

and really with penny stocks when you try to 
buy into the bottom of a move while the stock  

is in a downtrend that's often referred to as 
trying to quote unquote catch a falling knife  

odds are by doing this you're going to get cut 
and odds are by doing this you're probably going  

to take a loss on the investment so if we take the 
example here with sndl we're looking at again the  

long-term chart so we're looking at the daily 
chart in this example and you can see that it  

is of course in a long-term downtrend making 
both lower lows and lower highs along the way  

and i wanted to use this example because sndl 
actually recently had a pretty big spike up from  

its low of 13 cents all the way up to a high of 
60 cents per share just a few days later and it's  

very common for these types of penny stocks to be 
in a long term downtrend but still every once in a  

while have a big spike up in their stock so when 
that happens a lot of people get interested and  

try to invest in these thinking that the bottom of 
the move is in and the stock is going to reverse  

and start to actually trend upward but when this 
happens you have to actually ask yourself has  

anything with the company itself actually changed 
or is this just a short-term temporary balance  

in the stock price before it comes straight 
back down and continues with its downtrend  

most of the time you're going to find the answer 
is just that the stock has had a temporary bounce  

and there's nothing wrong with taking 
advantage of that temporary bounce by  

day trading it or swing trading it but you 
can't look at it as a long-term investment  

if the underlying company is still performing the 
same because the stock is most likely going to  

continue performing the same as well okay and 
that's going to lead us to reason number two  

which is that penny stocks are most 
often going to have poor financials  

every penny stock on the market represents an 
underlying company and these penny stocks are  

penny stocks for a reason most of the time the 
companies that they represent are going to be very  

poor financially they're not very profitable 
companies they don't have strong revenues  

they're not showing eps growth and odds are 
they're not going to be the next apple they're not  

going to be the next amazon and they're probably 
not going to be a great long-term investment  

a few things that you do want to look for 
when it comes to a good long-term investment  

first is a current quarterly earnings per 
share or eps growth of at least 20 percent  

following that you want to see also that there is 
an annual eps growth of at least 20 percent and  

you want to see that there is ideally some high 
institutional ownership in the stock by doing your  

research you're going to find that there is very 
few penny stocks that actually meet these three  

criteria because again penny stocks are usually 
going to have much more poor financials and one  

way that you can look for stocks that actually 
meet this criteria is by using so all you have  

to do is go over to finbis and click on screen or 
up here at the top and because this is fundamental  

data rather than technical data we're going to 
go ahead and click on fundamental and you can  

see right here from the start we have a total of 
7 622 stocks here in this screener and to narrow  

this down we're going to first look for an eps 
growth quarter over quarter of at least 20 percent

followed by eps growth over the 
past year of at least 20 percent

followed lastly by institutional ownership of at 
least 30 you can see that right off the bat we  

already narrowed the market down to a total of 380 
stocks all meeting these three financial criteria  

and what you're going to notice is that if you 
hover over the price of these stocks over here on  

the right side you can see that very few of them 
are actually penny stocks and that's again because  

most penny stocks are not going to have strong 
enough financials to meet this criteria which  

again is one of the big reasons why penny stocks 
are not going to make great long-term investments  

okay and that's going to lead to number three 
which is that penny stocks often have dilution  

in its simplest form what dilution does is 
drives the stock price lower by creating a  

huge amount of supply in the market at the end of 
the day the market is going to move solely based  

on supply and demand if there's more demand than 
there is supply at a certain price that demand  

is going to push the stock price higher and 
if there's more supply than there is demand  

meaning that there's more sellers than there is 
buyers at a certain price that supply is going to  

push the stock's price lower and dilution is very 
commonly seen in penny stocks which creates again  

a large amount of supply and is going to most 
likely push the price of the stock down lower so  

for that reason whether you're day trading swing 
trading or looking for a long-term investment  

one thing that i always recommend doing is going 
on to a website like bamsec.com or even something  

like scc.gov or otcmarkets.com somewhere where you 
can look for sec filings in a company and checking  

to see if there's been any recent dilution in the 
stock so i'm going to go ahead and search for ttnp  

uh this was an example of a stock also 
that recently had somewhat of a spike up  

you can see that down here um it spiked from a 
low of about 11 cents per share all the way up  

to about 25 cents per share within just a few 
days and then came straight back down which is  

very commonly seen with penny stocks because they 
often fail to hold their gains when they spike up  

and in this case the reason that it came straight 
back down and actually ended up going even lower  

is because the day after this spike here under 
prospectuses and registrations on bmsec.com  

you can see we have a 424b5 filing which tells us 
that the company is doing some kind of dilution  

so in this case what this offering and what the 
solution is telling us is that there is 80 million  

units each one consisting of one share of common 
stock as well as one warrant which is going to be  

sold into the market for this stock so essentially 
it's creating 80 million extra shares of supply  

which is going to of course take a huge amount 
of demand for the stock to actually break through  

and continue pushing higher so what ends up 
happening is all that supply just drives the price  

of the stock even lower and while this does happen 
every once in a while with large cap stocks it is  

definitely much more common with penny stocks 
and is one of the big reasons why penny stocks  

make such risky long-term investments okay so 
number four is going to be that penny stocks also  

have less liquidity and less volume liquidity 
and volume is very important because every time  

that you buy shares there has to be somebody on 
the other side of the trade to actually sell you  

those shares and vice versa every time you sell 
shares there has to be somebody on the other side  

to actually buy those shares from you so when 
you're trading or investing in these illiquid  

penny stocks that on any given day may only 
trade a few thousand shares here and there  

it can often be very difficult to actually find 
somebody on the other side when you're looking to  

buy or looking to sell your shares in my opinion 
when i'm looking for either a day trade a swing  

trade or even a long-term investment i like to see 
that there's at least an average volume of 100 000  

shares every single day anything below that no 
matter how many shares you're trading even if  

it's just a few hundred or a few thousand shares 
it can be difficult to find somebody on the other  

side of the trade to buy your shares from you or 
to sell your shares too so going back to the fin  

biz screener that we talked about just a minute 
ago uh you can also put in average volume criteria  

as well to narrow the market down even further so 
because this is technical data we want to go ahead  

to all and then down here on average volume we're 
going to go ahead and select over 100 000 shares  

so now we know that every single stock in this 
list is going to not only have eps growth over  

the past quarter and over the past year as well as 
institutional ownership of at least 30 percent but  

they're also going to have enough volume for us to 
actually take position in knowing that they're not  

to a liquid and we're not going to have any issues 
trying to buy or sell shares and really that is  

going to go hand in hand with number five which is 
that penny stocks are much more easily manipulated  

than larger price stocks one of the big 
ways that penny stocks are often manipulated  

is with pump and dumps and what this ends up doing 
is causes inexperienced traders to buy into the  

stock all the way up at the high right before the 
people that were promoting the stock start to sell  

and drive the price of the stock back down so what 
happens is the people that pump the stock up end  

up making a nice profit on the trade while the 
traders that were late to buy into the stock end  

up taking a loss on the trade and we actually had 
a really good example of this just a few weeks ago  

if we look at wei you can see that this was a 
stock that went from a low of about 73 cents  

all the way up to about five dollars and fifty 
cents and actually in after hours on this day  

it ended up getting up to over ten dollars per 
share and there was no news or anything to back  

up this big spike up in the stock so because it 
was a pump and dump the price ended up getting  

dumped straight back down and now it's all the 
way back to 1.46 cents per share but this just  

goes to show that penny stocks again can be much 
more easily manipulated and generally speaking you  

don't want to be heavily invested in something 
long-term if it can be so easily manipulated  

okay so those five reasons are why i think penny 
stocks are much riskier long-term investments  

and why i personally believe they should be 
only used for day trading or even swing trading

60,Misleading,"when there is a negative sentiment in

the market and the markets are in a

to invest in blue chip stocks and the

reason being that blue chip stocks are

small cap stocks now in this current

hike and on top of this the recent

russia ukraine war has created global

uncertainties so if you want to make use

of this fall in the market and invest in

relatively less volatile stock then you

can consider investing in top bluetooth

stocks of india that are available at

reasonable valuation here please

remember that valuation is a key there

are many great blue chip stocks in the

market but not every stock is available

at good valuation so in this video i'll

share the list of five blue chip stocks

looking very reasonable in terms of

valuation that you can consider buying

now but before you invest your money

make sure that you do your own research

and do not blindly invest based on this

video and don't invest all your money as

lump sum since we don't know how long

this uncertainty in the market would

last a good strategy is to keep buying

in a systematic manner on dips all right

let's get started

so first two stocks in the list are from

the banking sector now that the economy

is recovering post covet banking sector

would be the direct beneficiary from it

there's a huge amount of capex cycle

planned in the economy and that would

boost the business for banks on top of

this there's also a fall in provisioning

and bad loans so banking sector is

expected to post good numbers in 2022

but within banks be very selective with

top quality lenders that have a strong

balance sheet low npa and focus on

digitization to compete with new age

fintech firms so within this sector my

number one pick would be icsa bank iso

bank is among the top two private banks

in india and one of the most well-run

banks in india in the latest q3 result

icsa core operating profits have jumped

24.9 year-on-year to levels of 100.6

billion rupee there's an improvement in

its net asset quality as well and its

net npa for q3 stood at 0.85 percent

which is well under control its net

interest margin student 3.96 percent and

most importantly icsa bank is extremely

focused towards growing its digital

platform its imobile app not only

includes the basic features of account

opening credit card loans and investment

but you can send instant money to your

contact using upi scan and pay make bill

payments as well as recharges now if you

look at the revenues of icsa bank it was

at 59 294 crore in march 16 and then it

was slightly constant for next two years

but then it saw a rise in revenues and

currently it is at ninety two thousand

seven hundred and seven crore in

training twelve months if you look at

the profitability it was at 10 180 crore

in march 16 and then it saw fall in its

profitability but then since march 19

there's a sharp rise in profitability of

isis bank and in trailing 12 months its

profit stood at 22 277 crore

now next if you look at the other

financials icsa has a current price of

717 rupee it touched a high of 867 which

means there is a fall of around 17

percent from its peak apart from this it

has a market cap of around 5 lakh crore

rupees and has got an roe of 13.1

percent and the debt to equity is seven

please don't look at debt to equity

remember banks have a business model

where they borrow money and then they

pass it as a loan so bank work on this

model and debt to equity is not a right

ratio in banking model and if you look

at the targets on icci you can see that

mk global has given a target of 1050 and

then jeffries has given a target of

1040. so both these forms are given a

target of more than one thousand rupees

on icici which is currently trading at

levels of 717 which means there's an

upside potential of more than 40 percent

on icsa bank but please make sure that

you don't make your buy or sell call

based on these target prices these are

only for your reference purpose second

blue chip stock from the banking sector

is hdfc bank sdfc bank is number one

private bank in india in terms of

revenue as well as profits but

unfortunately sdfc bank has been an

underperformer for a long time now in

fact in the last one year sdfc bank

share price has fallen by around eight

to ten percent sjc bank has seen many

ups and downs in the last couple of

years in october 2020 rbi imposed ban on

hdfc bank to issue new credit cards and

introducing new digital products due to

multiple outages in its digital banking

system this ban lasted eight months till

august 2021 it also impacted its growth

and credit card business then it also

saw a big change in leadership where

aditya puri the man that made hdfc bank

number one private bank of india retired

in 2020 so there were concerns over the

new leadership but sjfc bank new ceo mr

sashida jagdishan has been associated

with the bank since 1996 and was the cfo

of the bank before joining as ceo now

that sdfc bank has revamped this

technology platform i believe that sjc

bank will regain its position in its q3

result sdfc bank has posted 18 jump in

its year-on-year profit and its net np

has also reduced to 0.37 percent which

is among the lowest npa in the banking

sector so i am very optimistic about the

out performance of sdc bank in the

future if you look at the revenue of

hdfc bank it was 63 162 crore in march

16 and currently at 1 lakh 32 969 crore

and trailing 12 months look at this

consistent rise in revenues of hdfc bank

next if you look at the profitability

its profits today 12 800 1 crore in

march 16 and currently at 36 0044 crore

in trailing 12 months look at this

consistent rise in the profitability of

sdfc bank if you look at the other

financials sdfc bank is currently

trading at levels of 1380

and it touched a high of 1725 so the

stock is down around 20 from its peak

and it has got a market cap of around

7.64 lakh crore and an roe of 16.5

percent next if you look at the targets

on sdfc bank jeffries has given a buy

price on with a target of 2160

and it is at current levels of 1380

which means there is an upset potential

of more than 50 percent you can see that

it says that as jeffrey believes that

sdfc bank is set for a come back year

after uh under performance and expect 18

chr in profit over 22 to 24 an

improvement in net interest income and

that is around 16 to 17 percent and that

is the reason for re-rating

part of the chip stock in my list is

from id sector and the reason for

picking it sector is very simple india

is a leader in the id services and would

continue to be the leader globally

indian id companies have the required

talent pool with the right skill set and

of course indian id companies are much

more cost efficient as compared to

global players due to its low cost

workforce and within the id sector the

large cab id companies are placed in a

sweet spot due to huge availability of

talent pool strong and experienced

leadership and a proven track record of

decades with good relationship with

global giants so within the large cap id

sector i would pick hcl technologies now

you might ask why not tcs or in courses

so all these three companies are among

the top players in the indian id sector

with good growth high profitability

negligible debt levels and huge amount

of free cash flow for investment in

future technologies but one key

difference is valuation hcl has a p

ratio of 27 whereas tcs latest p ratio

is 34 and infosys p ratio is 33 so hcl

has a much better valuation among all

these three companies and more

importantly hcl has won many new big

contracts and has a very strong deal

pipeline which is growing quickly and

this would get reflected in the coming

quarters if you look at the revenues of

hcl technologies it was

3136 crore in march 16 and from there it

jumped to 82 695 crore in trailing 12

months again there is a consistent rise

in the revenues of hcl technologies now

if you look at the profits of hl tech it

has grown from 5 600 two crore in march

16 to current level of eleven thousand

eight crore in trailing 12 months now

one of the reason why there's a

stagnation between march 2021 and

trailing 12 month is because in march

2021 hcl tech gave away profits worth

700 crore to its employee and one of the

reason why trading 12-month profits are

not high is because of in fall in your

margins which is due to your increase in

employee cost if you look at the other

financials of hcl type you can see that

it is currently trading at levels of


it touched a high of

1378. so again it is down 20 from its

peak and it has got a market cap of

around

3.202 lakh crore and

again it has got roc of 25.7 percent

which is brilliant roe of 19.8 percent

which is brilliant debt to equity of 0.1

which is almost negligible so all in all

you can see there's a free cash flow of

34 932 crore so financially hcl tech is

looking very solid and if you look at

the targets modular oswald has given a

target of 1 690 rupees on hcl tech and

currently hcl is trading at levels of 11

which means there is an upside potential

of more than 50 percent on hcl tech

number four blue chip stock is reliance

industries the reason is simple reliance

jio is a leader in indian telecom sector

and the indian telecom is one of the

fastest growing market in the world due

to affordable smartphones and low-cost

internet since the government has also a

lot of focus on digitization telecom

sector would see huge growth in the

future and remember that telecom is a

highly capital intensive business so

there is a high entry barrier in this

sector and reliance jio would benefit

from this entry barrier then reliance is

also among the leader in the indian

retail business right from reliance

fresh to reliance digital to reliance

trend to reliance smart and the list

goes on moreover now reliance retail is

also penetrating into the e-commerce

retail with reliance geo mark and again

the organized retail sector in india

would see huge growth due to increasing

consumer spending not only this reliance

has now also faded into green energy

business which is the future of energy

reliance has recently signed an mou with

gujarat for a total investment of 5.95

lakh crore over the span of 10 to 15

years to set up 100 gigawatts renewable

energy power plant and green hydrogen

ecosystem development last year vocation

money has already announced the setup of

four giga factories in jamnagar to build

an entire ecosystem around renewable

energy production and transmission again

green energy production requires huge

investment and hence it has a

significantly high energy barrier so all

in all reliance is all set to benefit

from all its three businesses of telecom

retail and green energy and all three

sectors have high entry barrier so

reliance is among the top blue chip

stock to invest for long term wealth

creation if you look at the revenues of

reliance industry it was a 2.72 lakh

crore in march 16 and from there it is

at 6.42 lakh road in trailing 12 month

again there's a good rise in

profitability although there was a

slight fall but again there's a good

rise if you look at the profits of

reliance the profits have jumped from 29

345 crore in march 16 to 57 729 crore in

trailing 12 months again there's a

consistent rise in the profitability of

reliance industries and if you look at

the other financials it is currently

trading at levels of 2400 and it touched

high of 2750

which means reliance is down around 12

percent from its peak and has got a

market cap of around 16.2 lakh crore and

apart from this it's got a roc of eight

point one nine percent and roe of seven

point nine seven percent and that equity

of 0.36 and if you look at the targets

morgan stanley has maintained an

overweight rating on stock with a target

price of 2926

which means from current levels of 2400

reliance has an upside potential of

around 20 percent

number fifth stock is from the

infrastructure sector it is lnt for the

indian economy to grow it has to focus

on infrastructure and indian government

has a lot of focus on infrastructure

building including the highways flywars

rail network airport ports and so on in

fact in the recent budget also the

government has clearly focused on capex

to build the infrastructure in india and

one company that is the leader in this

sector is lnt it has been among the

leader in various sectors including

construction heavy engineering mining

machinery defense defensive building

metallurgy and so on so it is not just

only involved in building roads and fly

wars but also involved in quite complex

projects including power defense heavy

engineering hydrocarbon and so on just

to give you an idea of lnt scale it has

an order book of rupees 3.4 lakh crore

so yes it is not just lacquer crore it

is 3.4 lakh crore that's the order book

of lnt and that has grown by 18 year on

year so lnt has got multi-year revenue

visibility out of this 75 percent order

are from india and 25

are from other countries in short the

future of infra is bright and lnt is the

most preferred partner with a deep mode

of strong leadership and years of

experience if you look at the revenues

of lnt it was 1.01 lakh crore in march

16 and touched a high of 1.51 lakh crore

in trailing 12 months so there is a good

rise in the profitability although the

growth is not that high and if you look

at the profits look at this sharp

increase in profitability year on year

it was at 4281 crore in march 16 and

currently at 8 341 crore in trailing 12

months now one of the reason in fallen

profitability is due to increase in

taxation and another reason is this was

an exceptional year with an increase of

8 000 crore worth of other income and if

we look at the other financials of l t

it is currently trading at levels of

around 1800 it touched a high of 2079 so

stock is down around 14 percent from its

peak and it has got a market cap of 2.5

to lag crore roc of 15.3 percent roe of

19.3 percent of course it has got a high

debt levels because it is into a very

capital intensive business and if we

look at the targets on lnt jefferies has

maintained a buy call and the target

price is

2675 rupee currently lnt is trading at

levels of 1800 which means there is an

upside potential of more than 50 on lnt

so in this video we discussed the top

five blue chip stock with solid

fundamentals and a very robust financial

the list include icsa bank sdfc bank

reliance hcl and lnt all these companies

are among the leader in their respective

sector with a very strong economic mode

and above all they are all currently

available at a very attractive valuation

stock market has already corrected quite

a lot recently and that has made these

stocks very attractive in terms of

valuation so at current levels these

stocks have a very favorable risk reward

ratio any further fall in the stock

market would make them even more

attractive since nobody can time the

market and predict the bottom i would

suggest investing in a systematic manner

and keep buying on dips eventually when

the markets will recover these blue chip

stocks will certainly bounce back and

reward the investors that remain

invested during the tough time i hope

that as a fundamental investor you're

utilizing this correction in the stock

market as an opportunity to invest in

quality stock at discounted levels so

which is your favorite bluetooth stock

to invest in current market fall let me

know in the comments and i keep saying

that the best investment you can make is

investment in knowledge so if you want

to learn more about stock fundamental

analysis or everything about money

management you can explore my online

course i'll see you next video till then

take care

61,Misleading,"one blue chip stock has produced a 600 return over the last 20 years six times your money and nearly double the return on the overall stock market more than that it's one of the best  stocks to buy to protect your money in a recession hey Bowden Nation Joseph Hogue here with the  third in what is becoming the most popular series on the channel are just one stock videos if you could invest in only one stock in different themes which  should it be we're going to cover all the strategies here from value to growth tech stocks and by the end of the series

addressable Market as CRM estimates at

248 billion dollars sales Force controls

nearly 20 percent of the global market

for customer relationship management

software and services and that's four

times the next closest competitor Oracle

with just 4.8 percent share and here

what I think makes Salesforce more of a

blue chip company than a growth stock is

its Revenue history it's booked

long-term Revenue growth of 26 since

2014 that has been surprisingly

consistent While most growth companies

see a burst of growth that quickly slows

Salesforce continuously finds new

services and new customers to keep up

that growth now while Salesforce has

been aggressive in an acquisition

strategy over the last few years I don't

think it's the kind of problem that

we're going to talk about later

long-term debt is up to 13.3 billion but

only 24 on a debt to equity basis and

the company has doubled its cash on hand

to over the last three years to 10.5

billion so plenty of financial

flexibility the shares are down 45 from

the peak on that sell-off in growth

stocks but the analysts have an average

Target of 240 a share over the next year

nearly 40 percent up and this is one of

my favorite Buy and Hold Blue Chips of

all the investing themes we'll cover in

our one stock series blue chips are

probably the most misunderstood but but

also one of the most important for your

portfolio right now Blue Chip companies

are those Mega cap companies worth tens

of billions of dollars the most

recognizable brands on Earth and with

the most established businesses now

these are companies with economies of

scale that give them profit advantages

over their competitors and brands that

everyone knows and this all acts to make

these Blue Chip companies super

resilient in any kind of economy in fact

often we see these companies build

market share as those smaller

competitors struggle in a recession it

makes right now the perfect time to be

adding some Blue Chip stocks to your

portfolio in and why I wanted to make

this video third in our series

even if that broader Market stock market

Falls and drags down the Blue Chips down

with it they're going to be insulated

from the worst of the crash and they're

going to help protect your portfolio

until stocks head higher our next Blue

Chip is 284 billion dollar drug maker

Pfizer Inc ticker PFE with not only a

strong Blue Chip status but also paying

a 3.1 dividend as well Pfizer has a

worldwide reach with 1.4 billion

patients and doubled its sales during

the pandemic and the company is expected

to post 26 sales growth this year before

that falls 21 next year just on a drop

in vaccine demand but but this company

is a leader in drug Innovation

especially in the new mRNA technology

the new methodology could spark

breakthroughs not just in vaccines but

but across diseases and Medicine Pfizer

always has a full pipeline of new drugs

and launched 13 new clinical studies

last year ensuring that even his demand

for some vaccines and drugs fall new

ones are always there to take this place

more impressive though is that the

company has been able to do all of this

and been able to keep its operating

margin consistently above 25 percent

that's even as the need to spend

billions in research and Drug

development and has been able to grow

that without adding billions to debt

Pfizer's debt to equity ratio is just 44

versus competitors like Merck with a 77

percent of its capital structure in debt

analysts like Pfizer up to an average

Target of 57 a share over the next year

which is only about 12 percent higher

but this one is one that's going to

produce those consistent returns for

decades and we're just getting started

but you know I'm not about just telling

you to buy a list of stocks I want to

show you exactly what to look for in

Blue Chip investing because how you look

at these is going to be different from

other stocks like growth or dividends

and the first thing to narrow your list

of Blue Chip stocks is just making sure

it fits that definition of size and

financial scale I would start with only

stocks at a market capitalization so the

total value of all the shares of at

least 50 billion dollars now that's

going to cut your list of stocks you

need to research and make sure you're

only looking at the biggest powerhouses

in the market like all stocks I'm also

looking for higher sales growth and a

stronger operating margin versus

competitors and sales growth is usually

going to be slower for Blue Chip

companies just just by nature of their

size it's not as easy to grow a 200

billion dollar company at 20 percent

that as it is a one billion dollar

startup but you still want to see that

sales growth that's competitive that

said Blue Chips should outperform on an

operating margin that operating income

divided by sales to prove that they're

using their economies of scale to be

more efficient than others and remember

whenever you compare in sales growth or

operating margin or really any of these

fundamentals you want to do that with

companies in the same industry or sector

to get that fair comparison it just

wouldn't make sense to compare sales

growth for a beverage company against

that of a software tech company the

natural rate of growth just just isn't

comparable between the two industries

now these last two are the most

important factors that you want to watch

for when looking at these Blue Chip

stocks to buy first is the company's

recent Innovations and product and how

well it's keeping up with changes Nation

this is how Blue Chip companies die

management gets arrogant thinking it has

that dominant product and they stop

innovating pretty soon a startup comes

along that completely changes features

on the product or or how it's delivered

and that makes the Giant client of the

industry obsolete we saw this with the

Blackberry which back when I worked

Venture Capital even the coffee Runners

had blackberries but the company failed

to innovate when smartphones took over

we've seen it in media all the magazines

and the newspaper companies that have

failed to innovate into the online ERA

last factor and we'll get back to our

stock list and while debt is generally

less important for a blue chip company

another death risk is that debt-fueled

acquisition strategy you see a lot of

these Blue Chip companies will see their

sales growth slow and I think the answer

is just to buy growth through buying

other companies the perfect example of

this is a T's acquisition of a first

DirecTV and then Time Warner for tens of

billions of dollars and the problem is

buying growth is no excuse for

62,Misleading,"Starting from absolute $0 ($1,000) at 31
This is embarrassing but I am choosing to own it and move forward. I know it is not legal to give financial advice potentially even through discussions online but I thought it was worth a shot.

Basically I am a recovered addict. I used to work in finance as a mortgage broker, e-commerce underwriter etc. but I fell into bad habits and although I was working since fourteen I was never able to save due to ADHD/CPTSD. I've earned well over $600,000 and have nothing to show for it. Now recovered and diagnosed I am 31 with no super, no real expenses as my family is comfortable at the moment. I have $1,000 to my name personally. My income is only $1,000/fn until I start working. I am lucky enough to be on a disability support pension due to... horrific circumstances.

Currently unsure whether I will study financial services further and growing up I always imagined I would have my own business (I see the irony).

I am wondering, as I am in the dark on

Would be wise for me to start a superfund to make sure I am insured if I get a terminal illness or something bad happens out of my control.

What are some smart investment options for someone like me.

Does anyone have any insight in what would be smart to do starting from zero at 31.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you"
63,Misleading,"Instagram users are losing hundreds of thousands of pounds each month to investment scammers, new figures show.  

According to Action Fraud, 164 Instagram users lost £358,809 to investment scams as fraudsters in June 2020 alone. That's an average loss to victims of around £2,200

These fraudsters often contact people about opportunities to make eye-watering returns in a few days for a small initial investment.

Usually, this investment is a few hundred pounds (and the fraudster claims to take a small commission), making it attractive for those new to investing as the upfront cost is small.

Once the money is sent (by bank transfer or via a cryptocurrency platform), the scammers try and get more money by claiming profits cannot be sent due to tax issues before blocking them.

As savings rates are abysmal – at the time of writing, you can get 1.6% at best by locking your money away for five years – and people are spending more time at home, there’s more exposure to investment scams.

Before I reveal how a loveMONEY reader fell for an Instagram investment scam, it’s worth remembering that investing is usually a long-term commitment – short-term investment options are usually extremely high risk or a scam.

Clone firm investment scams: how they work & how to spot them 

Lucrative investment opportunity
In March, Robin (the victim’s name has been changed for anonymity) followed an alleged investment advisor who claimed they completed trades for clients on Instagram and had over 4,000 followers at the time.

The investment advisor Valencia (the scammer’s name has been changed in case they impersonated someone) contacted Robin about investing in oil stocks for £700.

Robin initially declined and said it was too much to invest upfront.

But she admits was tempted as Valencia posted images about the high returns she helped her clients achieve, investment graphs and an office showing a team working on investments.

A few days later, Valencia wrote a public post claiming she could accept a smaller upfront investment of £500, which caught Robin’s attention, so she got in touch.

After discussing the investment and the terms and conditions, Robin invested £500, which was the first time she had invested in anything.

She was amazed to see her investment in oil shares apparently soar from £500 to £13,000 within 24 hours and attempted to claim the profits.

At that point, she was asked for a ‘release fee’ of £2,400, which was demanded by HMRC, according to Valencia.

“She took a negative tone,” recalls Robin, who says that she was accused of ‘messing around’ when she asked for the fee to be taken away from her profits.

Robin was told that if she didn’t pay within hours, she would face additional penalties.

It was when Valencia suggested that she could try a payday loan, borrow money from family and friends, or use an overdraft, that Robin became suspicious.

She then threatened to send the £2,400 fee to debt collectors on behalf of HMRC, so Robin tried to contact Valencia's manager so she could try to resolve everything.

After making many excuses, Valencia claimed her manager didn’t want to talk to Robin due to her ‘attitude’ and kept pushing her to send the money, which convinced Robin it was a scam.

So, she did some research, found the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) register and asked Valencia for a registration number so she could verify her business.

While she was offered one, she couldn’t find Valencia on the register – so she blocked her and reported her to Action Fraud, Instagram and the FCA.

She also called her bank, Lloyds, which told her it would take 15 working days to investigate but didn’t get back to her during this time.

Unfortunately, when Lloyds got back in touch, they revealed they retrieved less than £2 from the account she sent money to.

So, she got in touch with loveMONEY to see if we could help.

HMRC tax evasion scam: how it works, red flags & more

What happened next?
I got in touch with Lloyds to see whether they could help as Robin was a first-time investor that was tricked into investments by misleading Instagram posts.

As the Instagram account was still active when Robin got in touch, I warned the FCA about the suspected scammer and also got Instagram to suspend the account so no one else would be affected.

“We have removed the account brought to our attention,” commented a spokesperson for Facebook, which owns Instagram.

“We do not want fraudulent activity on Instagram, and we invest in people and technology to block millions of fake accounts every day.

“We have also donated £3 million to Citizens Advice to deliver a UK Scam Action Programme to both raise awareness of online scams and help victims.

“We encourage people to report suspicious accounts so we can take appropriate action.”

Lloyds investigated what happened but refused to reimburse Robin on the grounds that she didn’t check the investment was genuine.

According to the bank, when she selected the payment category, she received a warning directing her to the FCA register (which she later used to identify the scam).

“Whilst we have every sympathy with Robin as a victim of a scam, when she transferred money as part of an investment opportunity she found on social media she, unfortunately, didn’t take sufficient steps to verify that it was real,” a spokesperson for Lloyds Bank said.

“We urge anyone approached about an investment opportunity to check that it’s genuine by contacting the firm on the phone number, email or website listed on the FCA site, or by seeking independent financial advice.

“Fraudsters often withdraw or transfer the funds as soon as they are received from their victims.

“When Robin contacted us to report the scam, we immediately contacted the receiving bank to attempt to recover any money that may have remained in the receiving account.

“Never be rushed into making a payment and remember that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”

This case sadly reveals that banks may not reimburse scam victims if they feel they haven’t taken enough precautions – or if you send money after being warned about a scam."
64,Misleading,"The point of any scam is to put money in the scammers’ pockets, whether they’re doing this directly—through fake-product scams, for example—or through phishing and more indirect means. “Scammers, through Instagram, are seeking something specific, such as personal, confidential and/or financial information,” says Lisa Schiller, director of investigations and communications for the Better Business Bureau of Wisconsin.

The fact that it’s an established social media platform may work in scammers’ favor. It gives users a sense of security that makes them less likely to suspect wrongdoing. “There is nothing particularly unique about Instagram that makes it vulnerable to scams, but it does provide a platform trusted by its users,” says Steven J.J. Weisman, an expert in scams, identity theft and cybersecurity. “And when it comes to scams, trust is critical.”

But let’s face it: People scam on Instagram because people continue to fall for these schemes.

“Instagram’s large, informal user base makes it a fertile ground for scammers,” says Vandan Pathak, a senior application security consultant at Optiv, a firm devoted to cybersecurity solutions. “Fraudulent accounts, which are easily created, blend into the crowd [comment sections] of legitimate corporate or individual accounts.”

Numbers aren’t available for how many people fall victim to Instagram scams each year, but we know that the fraud is increasing. According to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) data, “more than one in four people who reported losing money to fraud in 2021 said it started on social media with an ad, a post or a message.”

The FTC reported that in 2021, nearly 95,000 people reported about $770 million in losses to fraud initiated on social media platforms. Of that, 45% of reports were related to online shopping. And in nearly 70% of those incidents, “people identified a specific social media platform in their reports of undelivered goods.” Almost nine out of ten people named Facebook or Instagram. Here’s what to know and how to protect yourself from fake ads on social media.

What are common scams on Instagram?
Romance scams

How the scam works

“Romance scams are quite popular and have even happened to people I know,” says Chris Hauk, a consumer privacy champion at Pixel Privacy. “Scammers send messages to targets, claiming to be divorced, widowed or in some type of bad situation.”

What the scam entails

These con artists often use catfishing or military romance scams while they love bomb potential victims to simultaneously elicit sympathy and fake a whirlwind romance. “They’ll claim they need money to get out of their country or to escape from an abusive spouse,” Hauk says. “The scam may continue for weeks as they work to get victims to trust them, then they’ll ask for money.”

How to identify it

Once you know to be aware of this scam, it’s easy to identify. If a stranger suddenly likes a bunch of your photos and then contacts you on Instagram in a flirtatious manner, it’s cause for suspicion. If they ask you for money, don’t give them anything and cease communication.

“If an Instagram account is love bombing you yet unable to do a video chat or converse on non-Instagram platforms, it’s a red flag,” Eaton says. “If you reverse-image search the [profile] photo and it’s connected to other accounts, that’s another warning sign. And if they beg you for money before you even meet, keep your guard up—and your bank account protected.”

Lottery scams
How the scam works

In these Instagram scams, victims are told that they merely need to pay some income taxes or administrative fees to claim their prize. “It is impossible to win a lottery you haven’t entered, and yet people are contacted through social media and told that they have won a lottery, and they let their greed blind them,” Weisman says.

What the scam entails

A commonly occurring lottery-related scam that keeps turning up on Instagram involves Mavis Wanczyk, who won a huge lottery prize a few years ago. “Scammers pose as her on Instagram and then contact people and say that she is giving them a large sum of her winnings,” Weisman warns.

How to identify it

If someone contacts you claiming to be giving away a portion of their lottery winnings “to a few lucky people,” back away. This is a scam. If you need more convincing, Google the winner’s name. You’re likely not the first person the scammer has contacted, and you’ll probably see information on Google related to the scam.

Loan scams
How the scam works

“Scammers will contact you through Instagram, offering loans with terms that seem too good to be true, and once they have your financial data, they will disappear,” says Alex Hamerstone, director of advisory solutions at cybersecurity company TrustedSec.

What the scam entails

Social media is not the place to find a great deal on loans. “This scam has the scammer promising low-interest, instant money, but as soon as you make the first payment—up front, of course—they disappear without a trace,” Rogers says. “This is along the lines of the quick-money, low-hassle trick.”

How to identify it

It’s easy to identify a scammer in this situation because no legitimate loan officer will cold contact you through social media. These are scammers who will take your money and run.

False investment scams

How the scam works

“Investment scams and advanced-fee scams both entail giving the scammer money in exchange for some greater future reward that is never delivered,” says Paul Bischoff, a privacy advocate at Comparitech, a consumer-focused cybersecurity company. “Investment scams these days often revolve around cryptocurrency. Advanced-fee scams can be about products, services, jobs, lotteries or some type of shortcut.”

What the scam entails

“Bad actors post comments luring people to reach out to them for ways to ‘get rich,'” Pathak says. “Then they convince their victims to provide access to funds with the promise of doubling their value through various ‘investments’ in return for a share of the profits. Of course, the victim is then denied access to said funds and runs the risk of suffering even larger financial, data and/or identity loss.”

How to identify it

There’s no such thing as an investment shortcut, but the possibility of fast, easy money is enticing—and people fall for it. Investment scams involving cryptocurrency are particularly common on Instagram. “No one should ever invest in anything without thoroughly researching the person offering the investment and the type of investment itself,” Weisman says. “Legitimate investments are not solicited through Instagram.”

Job scams
How the scam works

These days, people are looking for recession-proof careers and profitable work-from-home opportunities, and scammers are taking advantage of that. These fraudsters seek out job searchers on Instagram with promises of dream jobs. The catch: The jobs don’t exist.

Through job scams, bad actors are trying to get your information to con you out of money or your entire identity. Legitimate employers will ask for information such as your social security number, but these are not legitimate job offers, and you shouldn’t give this information to someone who contacts you through Instagram or another social media site.

What the scam entails

Scammers troll Instagram accounts looking for people dissatisfied with toxic work culture who show signs of quiet quitting and then send them misleading or fake job postings to try and get their personal information or money. “Job scams turn up on Instagram because people trust the site,” Weisman says. “But trust me: You can’t trust anyone.”

How to identify it

Instagram itself says to “avoid job postings that sound too good to be true or ask you to pay anything up front. When clicking on a link from a job posting, watch out for websites that seem unrelated to the original job posting or that ask for sensitive information (like a government ID) but don’t use secure (HTTPS) browsing.”

So, what can you do? “If you see what appears to be a good job offer, you should research the company, and if it turns out to be a legitimate company, contact their human resource department to see if the job offer is legitimate or if it was a scammer posing as the company,” Weisman suggests.

And whatever you do, never give money to a so-called employer considering your application. That’s a red flag on LinkedIn, Instagram and every other social media site.

Credit card fraud
How the scam works

“These are pretty straightforward,” Hamerstone says. “People will sell you something [which you may or may not receive and which may be counterfeit] and then steal the credit card info you used for payment. Be sure that when shopping online, you are using payment methods that have consumer protection.”

What the scam entails

In this online shopping scam, con artists take your credit card information for goods they never intended to send to you. They’ll use your credit card number to make purchases on your account.

How to identify it

If you order something through an Instagram account and don’t receive it, you may have unwittingly engaged with a scammer. Keep a close eye on your credit card, and if you notice suspicious activity or unauthorized charges, report it to your credit card company immediately. The company will most likely cancel the card and issue you a new one.

Paid subscription services

JORG GREUEL/GETTY IMAGES

How the scam works

Bad actors will offer you rock-bottom prices on subscriptions to popular services. “They will get your credit or debit card info, then use it to make fraudulent purchases,” Hauk says. “Remember the old adage: If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.”

What the scam entails

These scammers track legitimate Instagram accounts to see who likes and comments on the account’s offers. They then mimic the accounts. Once you follow the phony account, the scammers will make you an even better deal—though it’s no bargain because it’s a scam—and take your payment information for nefarious activities.

How to identify it

These scammers take popular accounts and make subtle changes to the username, adding a period, underscore or extra letter to the name. At first glance, it may look like an account you follow. Instead of @readersdigest, for instance, you might come across @readers_digest.

If you have any questions about the legitimacy—and you should before making a purchase—look into whether the account is legit. Sure, you can trace a fake Instagram account, but you don’t have to get all technical. Usually double-checking the username will clue you in to whether you’re dealing with a scammer.

Phishing scam
How the scam works

Bischoff describes phishing as “an attack that uses social engineering to trick victims into handing over private information, installing malware or sending money.” Fraudsters may send you phishing emails or might even attack via text message, something known as smishing.

What the scam entails

In an Instagram phishing scam, someone tries to access your Instagram account by sending you a suspicious message or link asking for your personal information. “Instagram will never send emails or messages asking for your login information,” Hauk says. “If you turn over your password, you run the risk of being locked out of your own Instagram account.”

How to identify it

Most phishing emails are easy to recognize—you’ll spot grammar and spelling mistakes, incorrect company logos and, when you hover over links, suspicious URLs.

But spear phishing emails are trickier to spot. That’s because they’re tailored to an individual. “They come addressed to us by name, and they generally deal with specific subjects in which we are interested or appear to come from companies with which we do business or have accounts,” Weisman warns.

Thankfully, Instagram installed a new security feature that lets you determine whether an email that’s claiming to be from Instagram is actually from Instagram or is a spear phishing email. “The new feature enables you to compare the email you received with any security emails Instagram has sent in the previous 14 days,” Weisman says. “If the email you received isn’t shown on the list of emails legitimately sent by Instagram in the last two weeks, you can be confident that it is a spear phishing email and know to ignore it.”

Inauthentic sellers
credit card mouse trap
PAGADESIGN/GETTY IMAGES

How the scam works

Inauthentic sellers offer too-good-to-be-true sales on popular items and try to create a sense of urgency to get buyers to act quickly.

What the scam entails

These scammers request payment through a nonsecure method or misrepresent their location in their posts. “Similar to credit card fraud, these sellers will get you to buy something and then either send you counterfeit goods or just steal the payment card information you sent them,” Hamerstone says.

How to identify it

It’s worth repeating: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. If the seller is pressuring you to use Zelle or another peer-to-peer payment method, shop elsewhere. This may be an Instagram scam. And unlike credit cards, money-transfer apps usually have little to no fraud protection.

In other words, you’re unlikely to get your money back if you fall for a Venmo, Cash App or Zelle scam.

Fake copyright scam
How the scam works

In this newer Instagram scam, con artists attempt to steal your Instagram password and go phishing for your email login.

What the scam entails

Victims receive a legitimate-looking email from someone posing as Instagram. According to the Better Business Bureau, the email goes something like this: “You have violated copyright laws, and your account will be deleted within 24 hours.” It also tells you that, if you think Instagram has made a mistake, all you need to do is click the button and “verify” your account.

At this point, you’ll be redirected to a website that prompts you to input your Instagram credentials. That would be bad enough, but this scam goes one step further. A pop-up asks you to verify your email address. You’ll see a list of email providers, and the site will prompt you to enter your email address and password.

This one is especially tricky because, after you’ve given up your Instagram and email login information, the phony site will redirect you to the real Instagram website as a clever way to make you think the interaction is aboveboard.

How to identify it

Your best defense is to double-check the “from” address in the email to be sure it’s actually from Instagram. “Any email from an Instagram representative will come from an address ending in @mail.instagram.com,” Eaton says. “If an email comes from somewhere else—even if it looks and sounds authentic—do not respond to it. And if you have questions, phish@fb.com and phish@instagram.com are legitimate, real email accounts that were set up for you to forward dubious messages.”

Eaton adds that Instagram won’t message you about copyright violations or send requests for your password. “Do not respond or reply to these messages, and never, ever click on any of the links,” she says.

How can you avoid Instagram scams?

“Humans are diverse and complex, and sadly, some people are emotionally unwell,” Eaton says. “Especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, there’s been an influx of isolation, fear and upheaval. Platforms like Facebook or Instagram might be their only outlet. This doesn’t excuse [scammers’] behavior, of course. It’s ugly, painful and can ruin lives. But the better we can understand their motivation, the better we can protect ourselves from bad actors.”

Hamerstone recommends the following actions, which will help you protect yourself.

Trust your instincts and remember that anything that seems too good to be true almost always is.
If anyone is asking you for information or money, take a step back and think about why they might be asking for it. Scammers often give a sense of urgency, knowing that the more time the victim has to think about the scam, the less likely they are to fall for it.
Never send anyone money if you don’t know them.
Never give anyone your passwords or other personal information.
If someone is befriending you, especially someone famous, research to ensure it is a real account. Look to see how long the account has been in existence and how many followers it has. Look for the celebrity’s verified account.
Remember that no legitimate commerce is conducted using gift cards.
Do not reuse passwords across multiple apps or websites. This is a common way for scammers to get into your accounts. Instead, pick strong, unique passwords.
If you think you have fallen victim to a scam, change your password immediately and look at your account to see if anyone else is logged in.
Use multifactor authentication.
Be aware of how the world works. For example, it is unlikely that an international supermodel wants to meet up with you and needs you to send money for a plane ticket.
Remember that Instagram won’t ask you for your password. If someone claims to be from Instagram and is asking for personal information, it is a scam.
Don’t click on links sent by strangers.
If a friend or relative reaches out to you for money on Instagram, call or text outside Instagram to ask if the request was legit.
Beware of anyone asking you to leave the Instagram platform and switch to communication elsewhere.
What should you do if you’ve been scammed on Instagram?
If you’ve engaged with an account that you think is an imposter, you should immediately report and block them on Instagram.

Here’s how to report a user on the app:

Tap the scammer’s username to go to their profile.
Tap the three dots found in the top-right corner of the profile.
Tap “Report.”
Tap “Report Account.” Select a reason for the report. Options include “It’s posting content that shouldn’t be on Instagram” and “It’s pretending to be someone else.”
Select “Scam” or “Fraud.”
Tap “Submit Report.”
Tap “Next.”
Unfollow and block the scammer.
Bischoff says the action you take depends on the nature and severity of the scam. “If you spot a scam but haven’t fallen for it, you can report it to Instagram and cancel any cards that might’ve been impacted, change the password on any account for which you’ve handed over the password and freeze your credit if you think you might be an ID theft victim.”

Consider, too, what type of protection your payment method has. “Debit cards and credit cards have different levels of consumer protection,” Eaton says. “Credit cards protect you from fraud far more comprehensively, by the way, which is why they’re safer to use for online purchases. But let your bank know so they can stop the bleeding, protect your assets and help you recover.”

You can also file a claim with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center and via the Federal Trade Commission’s Report Fraud site. Your local police department could also help because the crime occurred in its jurisdiction.

“How your money was stolen will directly impact your potential for recovery,” Eaton says. “Either way, the best way to recover from an Instagram scam is to not fall for it in the first place. So stay vigilant. Just like the real world, in the cyber-land of Instagram, not everything is what it seems.”"
65,Misleading,"Instagram is the ideal place to perpetuate scams of this sort. Scammers often pose as self-made millionaires, posting photos of themselves in expensive clothes, posing in front of mansions and luxury cars to perpetuate an image of success. They are living the good life and want you to show you how you can, too — for just a small investment.

Depending on the complexity of their deception, they may even have fake websites that show how your investment is performing, which encourage you to keep sending more and more of your hard-earned cash.

Other times, they take your initial investment and you never hear from them again. Either way, the only secret to their success is that they are making their money by stealing from Instagram users who believe the hype. Often times, catfishing is quite popular on Instagram, so it’s definitely something you need to look out for.


Influencers (and wannabe influencers) on Instagram are nothing new. They’re all trying to cash in by amassing followers and using their popularity to seal deals with brands. The goal? To get free stuff and get paid for promoting things to their followers.

Unfortunately for influencers, cybercriminals know how to entice them — with the lure of a lucrative collaboration. Scammers often reach out to influencers with promises of deals.



Consumers reported losing more than $80 million to cryptocurrency investment scams between October 2020 and March 2021, an amount 10 times higher than the same period a year earlier, according to the Federal Trade Commission.
Experts say the scammers often rely on social media, stealing users photos and videos to create fake profiles that lure in victims with the promise of huge returns on a crypto investment.
Several Instagram users told CNBC they have been reporting imposter accounts for years and so far, not much is being done to prevent it from happening.
Imagine logging into Instagram and searching your name to find more than a dozen imposter accounts pushing crypto scams while pretending to be you. That’s been Jason Sallman’s nightmare for the past several years.

Sallman describes himself as a “crypto-evangelist” and a lot of the content he posts includes images of Bitcoin.

The photo below is from Jason’s real instagram account, @JasonSallman.


But if you type “Jason Sallman” into Instagram’s search engine, you will likely see many other accounts using his images under handles that are often some variation of his name.

Jason Sallman said scammers are stealing his photos to create accounts that impersonate him on Instagram.

Sallman estimates he’s had more than 500 imposters over the past few years and said he’s seen up to 25 active Instagram imposters at once. He says going through the process of finding and reporting them all to Instagram can feel like a full-time job.

“There’s a little function inside of Instagram where you can report an account,” Sallman said. “And then they’ll review it and sometimes it could take them as little as two hours to respond, sometimes it takes days, sometimes they never respond.” 

Imposters have brazenly stolen photos featuring Sallman with his wife and family, and have even tagged his wife in new posts under a fake account.

66,Misleading,"The market is up roughly 3 out of every 4 years. There have been no 20-year periods where the U.S. stock market has been down on a nominal basis. I’ve gone over these kinds of stats ad nauseam over the years.

But why is this the case? Why does the stock market go up over the long-term?

I know a lot of people think the Fed controls the stock market or low interest rates or it’s the Illuminati that’s pulling the strings.

In reality, the biggest reason the stock market goes up over time is because the economy grows and corporations earn more money.

In 1928, earnings per share for the S&P 500 was $1.11 while corporations paid out $0.78 per share in dividends. It was impossible to do so at the time, but if you could have owned an index fund, those would have been your per share cash flows at the time.

By the end of 2021, those numbers $197.87 and $60.40, respectively. This means over the past 94 years, earnings on the U.S. stock market have grown at an annual rate of 6% while dividends have grown 5% per year.

Being an investor in the stock market means you get to take part in the profits and cash flows of corporations. You get to benefit from their innovation, investment and growth.

Let’s look at the biggest stock in the market as an example.

In its fiscal year ending 2014, Apple had sales totaling more than $182 billion with a net profit of $39.5 billion. In the fiscal year ending 2021, Apple’s revenue was $386 billion and the company produced net profits of $94.7 billion.

Sales more than doubled while the company’s profit was up 140%. Meanwhile in that same time frame, Apple paid out more than $103 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends.

And Apple is not alone in paying out dividends to shareholders.

This number has gone down in recent decades with the rise in share buybacks, but the average payout ratio for S&P 500 corporations since 1928 is more than 50%. This means companies have paid out more than half of their profits to shareholders in the form of cold hard cash.2

The market value of the entire U.S. stock market in 1982 was $1.2 trillion. Apple alone is now worth more than $2.5 trillion. The stock market goes up over time because businesses get bigger and earn more money over time.

If you own stocks, you earn a piece of that growth.

The stock market also goes up over the long-term because sometimes it goes down in the short-term.

And if you think about it — the stock market has to go down. It wouldn’t offer such juicy returns if you didn’t get your face ripped off every once and a while.

Ten thousand dollars invested in the U.S. stock market in 1928 would have grown to something like $66 million today.3

But look at all of the carnage along the way to get to there:


When you invest in the stock market you don’t simply get 8-10% year in and year out.

No you get some combination of huge gains followed by bone-crushing losses. It has to be this way or the long-run returns wouldn’t exist.

If the stock market was easy everyone would become a buy-and-hold investor.

The fact that it’s not always "
67,Misleading,"With the S&P 500 down and the Fed aggressively raising rates, it's time to start worrying about the housing market again. The housing market is usually the last asset class to fall. And real estate generally lags the stock market by about six months.

That said, demand is still relatively strong from first-time homebuyers, trade-up buyers, and institutional investors. If you plan to buy a house, you should also think about what could go wrong. This way, you won't get blindsided in case things do.

Think about all the people who bought real estate in 2007 and early 2008. Things were going wonderful, then the global financial crisis hit! If they had to sell before 2012, they likely lost money.

For the record, I don't think the housing market will collapse like it did from 2006-2010. The millennial generation is in full buying mode. Meanwhile, foreigners are likely going to flood the U.S. real estate market again after two years of being shut out.

I do expect the median home price in America to decline by about 8% in 2023 due to affordability issues. With mortgage rates surging, real estate affordability has never been lower.

But like any good investor, it's good to see the other side of the story. The rate of price appreciation for the housing market will likely cool over the next 18 months.

Historical housing affordability 
A Slowdown In Housing Is Inevitable
The pace of house price growth will slow because it cannot outpace income growth by such a wide margin for too long. Bond-tapering and Fed rate hikes started on March 16, 2022. Meanwhile, house prices are high. Affordability is becoming an issue.

This pace of double-digit price appreciation in the housing market is unsustainable in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Instead, I think home prices will decline by 8% in 2023.

Let's go over some more details on why the housing market has some signs of concerns. With such concerns, you may want to invest in a publicly-traded REIT or a private eREIT from Fundrise, instead of buying a single asset with a large mortgage. Diversification is key in this hot market.

Why We Should Start Worrying About The Housing Market
Taking on massive debt to buy real estate at record highs is risky. You need to be sure you're following my 30/30/3 home buying rule before proceeding. If you follow my rule, you will significantly increase your chances of being able to comfortable afford your home.

Let's say you lose 50% on your stock and bond portfolio. You'll be upset, but be fine. If your property loses 20% of its value, however, this means you've lost 100% of your 20% downpayment.

Below is the latest U.S. house growth chart from January 1976 to June 2021. According to the Freddie Mac House Price Index, house price growth is at an all-time high. Noice the previous all-time high house price growth in the late 1970s and in 2006.

If you are buying property today, you need to be prepared for a potential rapid deceleration in prices. Therefore, you must buy property strategically if you do buy.

It's Time To Start Worrying About The Housing Market Again - U.S. house growth chart at record high - January 1976 - June 2021
In this scenario, you'll also probably still be fine – if you don't have to sell. But when property prices correct by 20% or more, many people become forced sellers because they've also lost their jobs.

I understand that millennials are coming of buying age and inventory is on the decline, making competition for buying a home fierce. However, only if you are fully cognizant of the following points I've highlighted below should you proceed with a property purchase today. 

Things To Know Before Buying Property Today
Before you buy one of the biggest assets in your life, it's good to know the current market condition. It's also good to know what could go wrong in the housing market.

1) Rents are softening
Given property prices are a function of rental income multiples, a real estate buyer should be looking to buy at similar pricing discounts from peak rental periods.

Rents softened in major cities such as New York City, San Francisco, Seattle, and DC due to the pandemic. However, I anticipate rents to rebound once we achieve herd immunity. But they may not as people scatter to lower cost areas of the country.

Pay very careful attention to the latest monthly rental figures before buying property. Home prices have increased while rents softened in 2020. Therefore, the valuation for home is much higher.

Home prices and rents started growing in unison in 2021, but rents started declining in 4Q2022. Rents are still declining in 2023.

National rent index and changes
2) Mortgage industry is still very tight
Here's what's going on in the mortgage industry, which is as stringent as it has ever been. Only people with 720+ credit scores and 20% downpayment have been able to get a mortgage. This is good in that a fallout is less likely in the future. But let's talk about some concerns.

Liquidity (Profitability) Concerns: A growing percentage of people are not paying their mortgages and banks are uncertain if and when payments will resume. As a result, his bank is only lending to the most financially fit customers.

Stricter Lending Standards: Due to liquidity (profitability) concerns, banks have significantly tightened lending standards. Here are some of the increased lending standards he mentioned to me back in 2020:

Temporarily stopped allowing for cash-out refinances
No longer fully counting RSU values when calculating how much a person can borrow
Schedule E income (rental income) when calculating how much a person can borrow is no longer included
No longer approving Home Equity Lines Of Credit (HELOC)
Minimum downpayment is 20%
Raised minimum credit score to qualify for a mortgage to 680
In other words, lending standards are as strict as it gets. As a result, perhaps there is upside to real estate liquidity if there is a reversion to pre-pandemic level standards sooner. But if lending standards continue to tighten, it may squeeze out the marginal buyer in the short-term.

3) Mortgage rates have surged higher
Mortgage rates hit record lows in 2020. Now, mortgage rates are at 16-year highs thanks to an aggressive fed.

My last mortgage refinance was in 4Q2019 when I locked in a 7/1 ARM jumbo ARM at 2.626%. I was pumped! However, today, that same rate is closer to 4.5% with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at about 6.875%.

Higher mortgage rates in 2022 and 2023 is the biggest reason to worry about the housing market again. Higher mortgage rates WILL slow down the housing market, which is why you shouldn't get into crazy bidding wars.

the housing market is currently frozen with sellers unwilling to sell and buyers unwilling to buy. The vast majority of homeowners have mortgage rates below 6%. They don't want to give up their low mortgage rates.

U.S. mortgage rates surging is a reason to worry about the housing market

4) Prices have surpassed their previous peaks in many cities
While every city is different, if you look at the prices in Denver and Dallas, you'll find that the prices are roughly 45% higher than they were in 2006-2007. This price performance is similar to San Francisco's. Meanwhile, hot cities like Seattle and Portland are only about 20% above previous peaks.

The US median existing home price is about 40% higher than its previous peak in 2007. We're talking about a median existing home price from $250,000 in 2007 to $420,000 today. That's significant. But then again, 16 years have passed. As a real estate investor, your goal is to invest in markets that have both underperformed and have the potential to catch up.

I would be surgically investing in heartland real estate through Fundrise, my favorite real estate investing platform. Fundrise specializes in single-family and multi-family properties in the heartland, where valuations are cheaper and yields are higher. The firm started in 2012 and has over 350,000 investors and $3.2 billion in assets under management.

As prices fade over the next 12-24 months, investing strategically with a platform like Fundrise makes sense. The investment minimum is only $10, so no mortgage or leverage is needed.

5) Tax reform takes time to negatively impact housing prices.
Conceptually, we all know that limiting state income and property tax deductions to $10,000 and limiting mortgage interest deductions on new mortgages up to $750,000 are net negatives for expensive coastal city real estate markets. However, it takes 1-2 years to start feeling the crunch of tax reform.

Think about it. Let's say you own an average 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom home for $1.5 million. Your property taxes alone cost $17,000 – $20,000 a year, depending on which state you reside.

Let's say you earn $120,000 a year. You'll have paid $6,000+ in state income taxes. In the past, you could have deducted the entire $23,000 – $26,000 from your income. Now, you are limited to $10,000 in deductions.

Some will argue that lower income taxes will offset these deduction limitations. Perhaps.

With Joe Biden as President, a whole host of new taxes could be increased or introduced. Given the government is in a deficit, higher taxes or cuts to resources are an inevitability. Tax reform is a headwind, not a tailwind for coastal city property price appreciation.

6) Inventory is slowly creeping higher
The construction boom we've experienced over the past several years is finally showing up in the data as a wave of new inventory hits the market. When there's more inventory, pricing comes under pressure if demand doesn't follow. Below is the latest housing inventory under construction and authorized, but not started.

Housing inventory ticking higher in 2022, as real estate investors should worry more about housing supply

Here's another latest housing inventory chart by Altos Research. Housing inventory is still way below normal. However, it's good to keep an eye on inventory given prices are also much higher.

latest housing inventory 2023
For some of the hottest cities for real estate, like Austin and Nashville, inventory is definitely creeping higher. If inventory gets too high, these heartland cities are at risk of a housing downturn. Take a look at this chart below that shows single-family permits way up for Austin, Dallas, and Nashville.

Personally, I wouldn't be investing in cities in the top-right quadrant. Instead, I would be investing in cities in the green, lower-right quadrant. You don't really want to invest in markets where home prices rose the most while also facing the most amount of increasing supply.

Cities with high single-family permits compared to price gains 
7) It takes a while to recognize a peak. 
The housing boom that began in January 1996 ended in March 2006. But it wasn't until the beginning of 2008 that people started to accept that the housing market had already peaked.

Until 2008, property investors were still clinging to hope or at least were in denial that prices would no longer be going up. Once Bear Sterns was sold for nothing to JP Morgan in March 2008, people started to panic.

Then Lehman Brothers went under on September 15, 2008, a full two and a half years after the housing market peaked. And things got even worse, with the S&P 500 finally bottoming out on March 9, 2009. At least as of 3Q2020, we already experienced an aggressive 32% decline in the S&P 500 in March 2020.

Below is a great chart that shows how badly housing prices corrected in some of our major cities. Notice how the previous boom lasted 10 years and the crash lasted 5 years. Therefore, 2021 could be the peak in the current housing boom. In fact, it probably is as I sit here revising this post in 2023.

US housing price boom bust by city
8) The stock market has crashed multiple times
We saw a violent 20% sell down in the S&P 500 in 4Q2018. Then we saw a 32% decline from peak-to-trough in the S&P 500 by March 23, 2020. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ corrected by 13% and 20%, respectively in 2022 already. As a result, investors need to watch out.

From policy errors by the Fed, to trade wars, to slowing global growth, to a potential war with Iran, to COVID-19, to a global pandemic, companies everywhere will be more cautious on their spending in 2022 and beyond.

Just know that prices tend to revert back to the mean or overshoot on the downside very 4 – 10 years. Real estate takes 2-5 years to correct, so there is no rush to buy now.

The S&P 500 corrected by 19% in 2022 and went into bear market territory. The NASDAQ declined by 33% in 2022. As a result, a lot of funny money stock market wealth evaporated. Real estate significantly outperformed stocks in 2022, however, real estate is also starting to fade.

Historical S&P 500 performance
Recognizing Signs Of Housing Market Strength
Although it's good to worry about the housing market again, let us also recognize reasons for some housing market strength.

Negative real mortgage rates.
The S&P 500 closed up 18% in 2020 and up 27% in 2021.
A rotation out of volatile stocks into more stable real estate.
Still not enough inventory.
The increased desire for income / yield.

68,Misleading,"Popular Bollywood actor Arshad Warsi and his wife Maria Goretti, are among 45 individuals and companies banned by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) from participating in the securities market, officials said on Thursday. The decision comes after an investigation into allegations of share price manipulation by certain entities of two companies, Sharpline Broadcast Ltd and Sadhna Broadcast Ltd, through uploading misleading videos on YouTube channels.
SEBI found that certain individuals uploaded false and misleading videos recommending investors buy shares of Sadhna Broadcast Ltd and Sharpline Broadcast Ltd for extraordinary profits. In addition to Arshad Warsi and Maria Goretti, some promoters of Sadhna Broadcast Ltd have also been restrained from participating in the securities market.

Along with the ban, SEBI has impounded illegal gains worth ₹ 54 crore made by the entities after misleading videos were uploaded on YouTube channels. Two separate interim orders detail the investigation's findings.

According to the interim order, Arshad Warsi made a profit of ₹ 29.43 lakh, Maria Goretti earned a profit of ₹ 37.56 lakh, and Iqbal Hussain Warsi made a gain of ₹ 9.34 lakh. These three individuals, among others, have been classified as volume creators by SEBI.

The investigation began after SEBI received complaints alleging that certain entities were engaging in price manipulation and offloading shares of Sadhna Broadcast Ltd and Sharpline Broadcast Ltd. The complaints alleged that misleading videos with false content about the two companies were uploaded to lure investors.

SEBI conducted an examination from April-September 2022 and found that there was a significant increase in the price and volume of shares of the two companies between April and mid-July 2022. False and misleading videos about Sadhna Broadcast Ltd were uploaded on two YouTube channels, The Advisor and Moneywise, during the second half of July 2022. Similarly, similar videos about Sharpline Broadcast Ltd were uploaded on two YouTube channels, Midcap calls and Profit Yatra, in the second half of May 2022.

SEBI classified the entities into categories such as creators of YouTube channels, net sellers/promoters and profit makers, volume creators, and information carriers. According to SEBI, these entities collectively helped create trading volumes and interest in the shares, spread false and misleading YouTube videos, and induced investors to buy the shares at inflated prices, thereby violating the provisions of PFUTP (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) rules. Collectively, net sellers/promoters and some of the volume creators made extraordinary profits as a result of this scheme.

In the case of Sadhna Broadcast Ltd, SEBI found that the elaborate modus operandi adopted by the entities, including the egregious misuse of patently false and misleading YouTube videos, had led to a drastic increase in the number of small shareholders, from 2,167 to 55,343, who ended up buying shares at an inflated price. The number of small shareholders increased from 517 to 20,009 in the case of Sharpline Broadcast Ltd.

Post a comment
SEBI has barred the 45 entities ""from buying, selling, or dealing in securities either directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever until further orders."" Additionally, the entities have been directed not to dispose of any assets, including money in bank accounts, without prior permission from SEBI until the impounded amount is deposited in the escrow account.

69,Misleading,"The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is cautioning brokerage firms about the way they market some real estate investment trusts after a review by the Wall Street watchdog revealed problems, according to a regulatory notice.

Some brokerages are giving investors information about non-traded REITs, which invest in commercial real estate, that include inaccurate or misleading statements about the potential benefits of investing in such programs, FINRA said in a notice posted on its website late Thursday.

The Wall Street self-regulatory organization said some communications promote REIT distributions that are paid to the investor as income but fail to explain adequately that those distributions include some return of principal.

REITs invest in commercial real estate, such as hotels and strip malls, allowing investors to profit from rising property values. Non-traded REITs often have higher fees for investors than publicly traded REITs.

Since non-traded REITs do not trade on securities exchanges, they can be illiquid or difficult to sell in secondary markets.

Some communications that brokerages give investors to promote the securities do not adequately explain such risks to balance the presentation of benefits, FINRA wrote in the notice.

FINRA has been honing in on improper sales of non-traded REITs for at least several years. In October, the securities regulator announced a settlement with a Syosset, New York-based brokerage, David Lerner Associates, which agreed to pay about $12 million to customers who bought into a $2 billion REIT. [ID: nL3E8LM6OL]

The regulator’s concerns also extend to unlisted direct participation programs, or DPPs, a type of security that allows investors to participate in the cash flow and tax advantages of an underlying investment, include real estate.

The non-traded REIT and DPP industries presently hold $62.4 billion in investments, according to Robert A. Stranger & Co., a real estate investment banking firm in Shrewsbury, New Jersey. The two industries raised $10.3 billion in investments in 2012.

FINRA’s guidance does not mention the brokerages it reviewed or how many.

It told the brokerage industry, however, that descriptions of the real estate securities they offer must be consistent with information included in the prospectuses for those securities.

Details about distribution rates must also be “fair and balanced,” FINRA wrote. For example, brokerages cannot describe them as a “yield,” which may improperly suggest the investment is a bond. They also must explain, among other things, that distribution payments are not guaranteed.

In addition, brokerages may not “cherry pick” historical performance information about REITs affiliated with current products they are pitching. Brokerage should include, with “equal prominence,” all information about affiliated or related REITs, FINRA said.

The Investment Program Association, a trade group for non-listed direct investment vehicles, said on Friday that it supports FINRA’s guidance. The measures are a model for “proper investor communications protocols,” said Kevin M. Hogan, IPA’s president and chief executive, in a statement.

The group added that non-traded REITs are overseen by multiple regulators and that brokerages that offer them typically require clients to meet certain thresholds for income and assets available to invest before investing in the securities."
70,Misleading,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday announced a crackdown against alleged stock promotion schemes in which writers were secretly paid to post hundreds of bullish articles about public companies on financial websites.

Twenty-seven individuals and entities, including a Hollywood actress, were charged with misleading investors into believing they were reading “independent, unbiased analyses” on websites such as Seeking Alpha, Benzinga and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.

According to the SEC, many writers used pseudonyms such as Equity Options Guru, The Swiss Trader, Trading Maven and Wonderful Wizard to hype stocks.

The regulator said had it identified more than 450 problem articles, of which more than 250 falsely said the writers were not being paid.

“This is different from the fraud cases that you usually see us bring,” Stephanie Avakian, acting director of the SEC enforcement division, said on the conference call.

“Here, we allege that the fraud was in presenting the analysis as impartial,” she said. “It was bought and paid for.”

Seventeen defendants including Galena Biopharma Inc , ImmunoCellular Therapeutics Ltd and Lion Biotechnologies Inc agreed to pay more than $4.8 million, including fines and restitution, to settle, and to refrain from further wrongdoing.

Not all defendants were required to make payments, and Galena, ImmunoCellular and Lion did not admit wrongdoing. None of the websites was charged.

The SEC filed lawsuits against the other 10 defendants in Manhattan federal court.

These defendants include Lidingo Holdings LLC, run by Kamilla Bjorlin, 46, an actress from Encino, California who performs under the name Milla Bjorn; and CSIR Group LLC, a New York firm overseen by Christine Petraglia, 49.

It is unclear whether those defendants have hired lawyers. A lawyer representing Lidingo and Bjorlin in separate litigation had no immediate comment. CSIR and Petraglia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The SEC also issued an alert warning investors that articles on investment research websites may not be objective and independent, and that they should never invest based solely on information published there.

Brian J. Regan

Personally, I struggle to understand influencer culture. It has seemed to me that I am an outlier. People tend to trust celebrities because they have achieved a level of success and perceived expertise beyond the average person. “They’re rich. They must know what they’re doing.”

Here are a few recent examples of celebrity investment schemes and corporate misinformation:

Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrencies and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) may someday have some productive relevance in the world, but for now they have proven to be nothing more than virtual gambling chips, money laundering vehicles, and frauds.

Floyd Mayweather, Jr., Manny Pacquiao, Tom Brady, and Lionel Messi are world renowned athletes. They all promoted cryptocurrencies of some kind. Tom Brady promoted the fraudulent FTX. Floyd Mayweather, Jr. settled SEC charges for not disclosing receiving payment for cryptocurrency promotion. These men have great abilities, no doubt, but why do we need to think these abilities extend to a financial vehicle as opaque as the thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence?

SPACs

Special Purpose Acquisition Companies or SPACs had a record year in 2021, with more than 613 SPACs and raising $145 billion in capital. On their face, SPACs look just to be another vehicle for companies to be brought public other than the typical IPO process. There is one glaring difference, however. SPAC sponsors typically receive ‘founder shares’ of up to 20% of the total shares outstanding. The SPAC founder shares heavily incentivize an acquisition because if a purchase is consummated the founder shares are suddenly worth 20% of the acquired company. This arbitrage is obviously attractive to founders.

It was quickly realized that SPACs could raise more capital in the IPO if they had a celebrity attached. The celebrities were attracted to the founder share arbitrage. NBA great Shaquille O’Neal jumped into the game for the easy layup.

Shaq’s SPAC made a $2.9B acquisition that is worth just $149M today. The lofty revenue growth projections have been met with revenue declines. It is unclear how much Shaq made or lost in the deal, but it is likely he has still profited handsomely since most likely none of his own capital was needed to receive his founder shares. The non-founder investors are clearly much worse off.

Meme Stocks

There was a trend in 2021-22 referred to as ""Meme Stock"" trading, where people were gathering on the Internet to pump heavily shorted stocks with failing business models. 

Bryce Harper is the Philadelphia Phillies outfielder who played in the 2022 World Series and is currently playing on a 13 year, $330 million contract guaranteed.

These facts should be completely unrelated, except that Harper tweeted during this fervor “GameStop to the moon! #HOLDTHELINE” in January 2021. I really hope that the average person with a Robinhood account did not listen to the ballplayer that makes $25,315,912.38 a year more than the median household. GameStop's stock price fell by about 88% a month later.

Adjusted EPS (earnings per share)

There are high-profile frauds like Bernie Madoff, Sam Bankman-Fried, Enron, Tyco, and Worldcom, but there are also everyday misrepresentations. According to Factset, in the fourth quarter of 2022, 72% of companies reported adjusted EPS (Earnings Per Share). I have found adjusted EPS to be intentionally misleading.

Adjusted EPS often adjusts out real costs like stock-based compensation. I am confounded why companies choose to do this. There is no rational reason to do this other than to have reporters parrot the fake number every quarter.

Some egregious companies will hand you a drug laced cigarette while trying to convince you it’s healthier than broccoli. Penn Entertainment has a “Special Charge” in 6 of the last 8 years. The smallest of these charges amounted to 7.8% of operating income. Look at their 2022 earnings press release, and you’ll see that they have made up all new accounting standards (Adjusted EBITDAR?) where they add back so many expenses that the reported number is 22.5x the actual Net Income number. That’s not a small fib.

Corporate Misinformation: Blatant Disregard for Shareholders

I was recently asked to review a company that made me laugh. It seemed like the most honest thing in its financial statement was when it stated it was unclear whether or not it would be a going concern in the next twelve months! It’s now bankrupt. One of the items in the financial statements that I found particularly ridiculous was the accounting for marketable investments in the balance sheet. It was quoted above Accounts Receivable in the statement, suggesting that it was nearly cash-like. For most companies, marketable investment generally reflects safe assets like investment grade bonds that will be liquidated and used for corporate purposes at some point. Not this company! This line item reflected a speculative bet on a “penny stock” biotech company. Of the $90M worth of “Marketable Investments” on the balance sheet, $88M was valued using “Significant Unobservable Inputs.” To its credit, the company disclosed this information…. on page 146 of the latest 10-k. Nothing would make me happier than to disclose the name of this defunct entity and its management, but I want to protect the parties that initially came to me with it.

Social Media

I do not have social media with the exception of LinkedIn (related to my employer’s requirements). I do not miss it. I get sent social media posts all the time that are intentionally misleading or objectively false for shock effect. I’m often asked questions that are outlandish but asked with great earnestness, likely garnered through a social media post. Social media posts usually do not come with a disclosure. Social media can be entertaining – I get it. I’ve been down the YouTube wormhole more than a few times myself. However, I beg people to find a more honest way to be informed.

This article is as therapeutic for me as I hope it is helpful to the reader. The examples of duplicity are far too numerous to capture in one article. Dishonesty and criminality are rampant and seemingly becoming more common in the financial world. There are sharks in the water. Be warned to swim with caution. It’s easier to avoid the sharks if you know they’re at your end of the pool."
72,Misleading,"raudsters may falsely claim to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or a state securities regulator in order to lure investors into scams, or even impersonate real investment professionals who actually are registered with these organizations. Fraudsters may misappropriate the name, address, registration number, logo, photo, or website likeness of a currently or previously registered firm or investment professional. They try to trick investors into believing that they are registered by using a number of tactics, including the following:

“Spoofed Websites.” Fraudsters may set up websites using URL addresses or names similar to those of registered firms or investment professionals to trick investors into believing that the fraudsters are registered or that the fraudsters are affiliated with a registered firm or investment professional.
Fake Profiles on Social Media. Fraudsters may set up profiles impersonating registered investment professionals on popular social media platforms and then message investors to solicit their money.
Cold Calling. Fraudsters may set up boiler rooms with teams of people cold calling investors to solicit their money while claiming to be employees of registered firms. The fraudsters may use technology to make it appear they are calling from the firm’s location.
Misrepresenting or Falsifying Documents. Fraudsters may recruit investors by misrepresenting that their firm was registered with the SEC, including pointing to the firm’s Form D filings to support the misrepresentation (to learn more, read this OIEA Investor Alert). Fraudsters may solicit investors by impersonating a registered investment professional and generating a fake version of a public report using the professional’s name and CRD number (to learn more, read this FINRA Investor Alert).
Registration of Investment Professionals. Many sellers of investment products or services are either brokers, investment advisers, or both. Most brokers must register with the SEC and join FINRA. Investment advisers that provide investment advice to retail investors generally must register with the SEC or the state securities regulator where they have their principal place of business.

Verify the identity of anyone offering you an investment. Don’t rely on the website or contact information the person provides you. If you suspect someone is falsely claiming to be registered with the SEC, do not give the person any money and do not share your personal information. Report the person to the SEC.
To quickly and easily check if someone offering you an investment is currently licensed or registered, use the search tool on Investor.gov. Once you confirm that the seller is licensed or registered, make sure you are not dealing with an imposter. Contact the seller using contact information you verify independently – for example, by using a phone number or website listed in the firm’s Client Relationship Summary (Form CRS) – rather than relying on contact information the seller provides you. To ensure you are looking at a genuine copy of the firm’s Form CRS, follow these steps:

In the “Check Out Your INVESTMENT PROFESSIONAL” search box on Investor.gov, select “Firm” from the drop down options and type in the name of the firm.
In the search results, click on the relevant firm and then click on “Get Details.”
Click on “Relationship Summary” or “Part 3 Relationship Summary.”
For additional information about Form CRS, visit investor.gov/CRS.

Watch Out for Red Flags             
Regardless of whether someone claims to be registered with the SEC, beware if you spot these warning signs of an investment scam:

Guaranteed High Investment Returns. Promises of high investment returns – often accompanied by a guarantee of little or no risk – is a classic sign of fraud. Every investment has risk, and the potential for high returns usually comes with high risk.
Unsolicited Offers. Unsolicited offers (you didn’t ask for it and don’t know the sender) to earn investment returns that seem “too good to be true” may be part of a scam.
Red flags in Payment Methods for Investments.
Credit Cards. Most licensed and registered investment firms do not allow their customers to use credit cards to invest.
Digital Asset Wallets and “Cryptocurrencies.” Licensed and registered financial firms typically do not require their customers to use digital asset wallets or digital assets, including so-called “cryptocurrencies,” to invest.
Wire Transfers and Checks. If you pay for an investment by wire transfer or check, be suspicious if you’re being asked to send or to make the payment out to a person or to a different firm, the address is suspicious (for example, an online search for the address suggests it is not an office building where the firm operates), or you are told to note that the payment is for a purpose unrelated to the investment (for example, medical expenses or a loan to a family member). If you wire money outside of the United States for an investment that turns out to be a scam, you likely will never see your money again. "
73,Misleading,"Investors increasingly rely on social media for information about investing.  While social media can provide many benefits to investors, it also creates opportunities for fraudsters.  Social media allows fraudsters to contact many people quickly, cheaply, and without much effort – and it is easy for fraudsters to post information on social media that looks real and credible. 

Fraudsters may disseminate false information anonymously or while pretending to be someone else.  They may make up credentials, create entirely fake profiles, or impersonate legitimate sources.  It can be difficult to track down who is behind a social media account, and anonymity can make it harder for fraudsters to be held accountable.  

Testimonials and Celebrity Endorsements.  Do not be swayed by testimonials or celebrity endorsements when making an investment decision.  Fraudsters sometimes pay people – for example, actors to pose as ordinary people turned millionaires, social media influencers, and celebrities – to tout an investment on social media.
Investment information found in social media also may be inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading.  Social media may convey false impressions of consensus or legitimacy, making it look like large numbers of people are buying an investment when this is not the case.  Fraudsters may use social media to lure investors into a variety of schemes, including impersonation schemes, “crypto” investment scams, romance scams, market manipulation schemes, and community-based investment fraud.  Here are a few scams you should be aware of:

Impersonation Schemes
Fraudsters may impersonate legitimate brokers or investment advisers or other sources of market information on social media.  For example, fraudsters may set up an account name, profile, or handle designed to mimic a particular individual or firm.  They may go so far as to create a webpage that uses the real firm’s logo, links to the firm’s actual website, or references the name of an actual person who works for the firm.  Fraudsters also may direct investors to an imposter website by posting comments in the social media account of brokers, investment advisers, or other sources of market information.

When you receive investment information through social media, verify the identity of the underlying source.  Look for slight variations or typos in the sender’s account name, profile, email address, screen name, or handle, or other signs that the sender may be an imposter.  When contacting a company or attempting to access its website, be sure to use contact information or the website address provided by the company itself, such as in the company’s SEC filings.  Similarly, only contact a broker or investment adviser using contact information you verify independently – for example, by using a phone number or website listed in the firm’s Client Relationship Summary (Form CRS).  Carefully type the website’s url into the address bar of your web browser.

Some social media operators have systems that may help you to determine whether a sender is genuine.  For example, Twitter verifies accounts for authenticity by posting a blue verified badge (a solid blue circle containing a white checkmark) on Twitter profiles.  While a verified account does not guarantee that the source is genuine, readers should be more skeptical of information from accounts that are not verified.

Fraudsters may even impersonate SEC staff on social media.  Like many companies and agencies, the SEC maintains a list of verified social media accounts, which is available at www.sec.gov/opa/socialmedia.

Fraudsters have also found victims by hacking into social media profiles and sending fraudulent investment opportunities to the hacked person’s contacts.  Be wary if someone – even someone you trust – sends a social media message recommending an investment, and be sure to check with them “off-line” to make sure that person actually sent the message.

“Crypto” Investment Scams
Fraudsters may exploit investors’ fear of missing out to lure investors on social media into “crypto” investment scams.  “Crypto” assets are marketed using a variety of terms, including digital assets, cryptocurrencies, coins, and tokens. 

How do you know if an investment involving “crypto” assets is a scam?  As with any other type of investment product, if a crypto investment “opportunity” sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  Promises of high investment returns, with little or no risk, are classic warning signs of fraud.  Fraudsters may post fabricated historical returns on their websites showing high investment returns.  Depictions of investment accounts rapidly increasing in value and providing large returns are often fake.  

If you are considering a “crypto” asset-related investment, take the time to understand how the investment works and look for warning signs that it may be a scam.  Carefully review all materials and ask questions.  Check out the background (including license and registration status) of anyone offering you an investment in securities using the search tool on Investor.gov.

Learn more about investments involving ""crypto"" assets on Investor.gov.

Romance Scams
Romance scams through apps or websites have become increasingly pervasive as fraudsters take advantage of anonymity to mask their deceptive intentions.  The fraudster may be located in another country and communication may be exclusively through messaging due to language barriers.  Do not invest money based on advice from someone you have solely met online or through an app.  Do not share any information relating to your personal finances or identity including your bank or brokerage account information, tax forms, credit card, social security number, passport, driver’s license, birthdate, or utility bills. 

The FBI issued a Public Service Announcement about fraudsters using romance scams to persuade victims to send money allegedly to invest or trade cryptocurrency.  How these scams typically work is the fraudster establishes an online relationship with the victim through a dating app or other social media site.  The fraudster gains the victim’s confidence and trust, and then claims to know about lucrative cryptocurrency investment or trading opportunities. The fraudster directs the victim to a fraudulent website or app.  After the victim invests and sees a purported profit, the website or app allows the victim to withdraw a small amount of money, further gaining the victim's trust.  The fraudster then instructs the victim to invest larger amounts of money and conveys a sense of urgency.  When the victim tries to withdraw funds again, the victim is instructed to pay additional funds, claiming that taxes or fees need to be paid or a minimum account balance must be met. When the victim can no longer pay the additional funds, the fraudster stops communicating with the victim and the victim cannot get the money back.

Other agencies and organizations also have issued warnings about romance scams, including:

NASAA Informed Investor Advisory: Romance Scams
CFPB blog: Break up with online romance scams
CFTC Customer Advisory Customer Advisory: Avoid Forex, Precious Metals, and Digital Asset Romance Scams
FTC Consumer Alert: Love, not Money
Be careful if someone claims to offer you an investment opportunity that is exclusive or based on “inside” or confidential information.  Do not take comfort because someone encourages you to make an investment through what appears to be a third party website or app.  The fraudster may be behind the website or app, and it may be a scam.  Also, be wary of any “opportunity” that requires you to use “crypto” assets (for example, Bitcoin or BTC) to purchase an investment.

If you encounter any issues withdrawing your money from an investment, do not put in more money to try to get your money out, and submit a complaint to the SEC.  If you believe you have been the victim of an Internet crime, report it to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center IC3.

Do not be pressured to act quickly.  Take your time to research an investment thoroughly before handing over your money.

Market Manipulation Schemes
Fraudsters can manipulate the share price of a company’s stock (either positively or negatively) by spreading rumors on social media. Fraudsters then profit at investors’ expense.  Fraudulent stock promotions on social media can take various forms, including memes.

Fraudsters may promote a stock on social media anonymously or while pretending to be someone else.  Fraudsters can set up new accounts specifically designed to carry out their scam while concealing their true identities.  Be skeptical of information from social media accounts that lack a history of prior postings or that contain minimal original content.

Fraudsters may use social media to conduct schemes including: 

Pump and dump schemes – pumping up the share price of a company’s stock by making false and misleading statements to create a buying frenzy, and then selling shares at the pumped up price. 
Scalping – recommending a stock to drive up the share price and then selling shares of the stock at inflated prices to generate profits.
Touting – promoting a stock without properly disclosing compensation received for promoting the stock. 
In other instances, fraudsters start negative rumors urging investors to sell their shares so that the share price plummets and then the fraudsters buy shares at the artificially low price.

Microcap Fraud.  Microcap stocks (low-priced stocks issued by the smallest of companies), including penny stocks (the very lowest priced stocks), are more susceptible to market manipulation.
Exercise extreme caution if there appears to be greater promotion of the company’s stock than of the company’s products or services.  Be skeptical regarding new posts on your wall, tweets, direct messages, emails, or other communications you did not ask for that promote a particular stock (even if the sender appears connected to someone you know). 

Community-Based Investment Fraud
Fraudsters often use social media to perpetuate community-based investment fraud (aka affinity fraud), which targets members of groups with common ties, including based on ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, military service, and age.  These scams exploit the trust and friendship that exist within groups. 

Many communities use social media as a way to stay connected and share information.  Fraudsters, who may be (or pretend to be) part of the group they are trying to cheat, may solicit potential victims on social media through posts or direct contact.  Fraudsters also may enlist group leaders, who then spread the word about the scheme on social media.  Those leaders may not realize the “investment” is actually a fraud, which means they too may be victims.

Know who you are dealing with and know what is being offered – even if you have something in common with the person.  Type the person’s name into the search tool on Investor.gov to do a background check.  Confirm that the person is currently registered or licensed, and find out if that person has any disciplinary history.

74,v,"Yo, I've been really bullish on the company VCI global, they came out with news awhile back where they partnered with Treasure global to develop a platform using AI tech. This was based in Malaysia and was going to heighten the travelling experience in Malaysia. They're programming the AI to be able to recommend the best travel offers for you like a place to stay, cheap travel options, scenery, etc… Every tedious task that comes with travelling pretty much is available to you with the use of their AI.

I was big on that but decided to hold off until i saw more. Well today they announced collaboration with Microsoft Azure AI and this partnership will revolutizne the tech landscape through Microsoft Azure.

VCi will be developing a transformative path and provide solutions in creating next-gen innovations while making inroads to tools like GPT-4 and Microsoft’s new AI chat tool Bing Chat Enterprise. They will also use Azure’s OpenAI Tech for their current and new projects which includes robosale platform which is an all in one AI sales platform

Markets in general have been pretty bearish these days but these guys are up 41% at pre-market so this is just nuts. I mean if this isn't the time then when is lmao? Thought i would share to get another take but god does this look good.

Good morning all! I am bringing you a favorable risk:reward setup shorter term trade setup on KAVL. Communicated disclaimer, NFA. This chart is relatively simple, but my analysis will be below it. I hope youre having a wonderful Wednesday!

r/pennystocks - KAVL Short-Term Swing Trade Idea
KAVL 1D Chart

So, let's begin with the price targets:

.4749

.4946

.5287

.5871

.6813

I chose these price points due to larger buy/sell blocks, support and resistance, and supply/demand zones...as well as some more technical levels - like, points of interest, etc.

Additionally, the RSI is currently oversold. This indicates that a reversal could be starting soon.

The diagonal white line is a longer term resistance trend line. I believe that if we break above that (we are likely to get rejected at it) then KAVL will go on a LONG term uptrend.

In conclusion, I am bullish on KAVL & I really like this low risk/high reward setup. Tomorrow I may give a brief rundown of what the company does fundamentally, too.'"
75,Misleading,"The debate about which is the best type of investment is as old as anyone can remember. However, even for the firm stocks aficionados, it is hard to refute the fact that real estate investing is the safest investment option around, which consequently makes it also the best one. Here are 7 reasons why real estate is the best investment, being the safest one.

1. Investing in land

Investing in real estate automatically means investing in land as well. Actually land can be quite a big chunk of your real estate investment, sometimes reaching well beyond 50% of the total amount. The best quality of land from a real estate investor’s point of view is that it is a limited resource. There is no way to make more land that what is already available (except for the very expensive method of land reclamation from ocean, sea, or river beds). This means that the price of land is set to keep going up indefinitely into the future, regardless of the general economic conditions. As a result, the total value of your real estate investment will also continue increasing in the long term. In addition, you can always use the land on which your income property is built to build a new, bigger property, which will generate more rental income for you; for example, you can replace a single-family property with a multi-family home. Last but not least, you can always leave land as inheritance for your children and grandchildren. So, the first reason why real estate is the best investment is because a large portion of it is investing in land, which is extremely safe.

2. Investing in tangible assets

The next reason why real estate is the best investment strategy is the fact that when you invest in real estate, you actually buy a tangible asset – an income property. While no market is insured against a collapse, including the real estate one, you will always have something physical in case you choose to invest in real estate. Let’s say that in the worst case scenario you can’t find tenants to rent your rental property to or rents are so low it does not make sense to rent out, you can still turn your income property into your primary home or you can sell it to make profit. On the other hand, if you lose money when investing in stocks, you will be left with nothing. That’s why real estate is the best investment option.

3. Real estate markets are relatively stable

In comparison with stock markets, real estate markets are quite stable. Stock markets are highly volatile, which means that you can make lots of money or alternatively lose lots of money within a few days or even hours. While the real estate market is also subject to some volatility, it is significantly less than in the case of stocks. This means that there is less risk associated with investing in real estate, which makes this type of investment safer. And safer investments are better investments. So, that’s reason #3 why real estate is the best investment possible.

4. Long term appreciation

As we said above, real estate markets are generally considered to be stable. Nonetheless, the overall long-term trend is that prices will always go up. Even if income property prices don’t increase significantly every single year in a particular city or neighborhood, long-run appreciation is a fact in real estate investing. If you buy an investment property today, you will definitely be able to sell it for more in 10- or 15-year time. One of the main drivers of rental property prices, as highlighted in point 1, is the fact that every single income property is built on some land, and land is a very limited resource. So, real estate appreciation is the 4th reason why real estate is the best investment, as it is the safest investment strategy in the long term.

5. Regular income

However, investing in real estate does not have to bring you profit in the long term only. Indeed, most investors purchase investment properties to make money in the short term, through positive cash flow. Regardless of how big or small your income property is, it will generate some monthly rental income for you, provided that you are able to rent it out to tenants, of course. Any smart real estate investor will only go for a rental property which provides more rental income than recurrent costs, meaning that it creates positive cash flow. In this sense, investing in real estate is quite different from investing in stocks, which do not guarantee to make moneyevery month or not even every year. The fact that income properties provide regular income is another reason why real estate is the best investment strategy, both in the short and in the long run.

6. Hedge against inflation

Inflation is a fact – i.e., the general price level goes up over time even if some prices drop down from one month to another. Real estate investing, thus, is an excellent protection against inflation. Even though all prices go up with time, the prices of investment properties go up more rapidly. That is to say that real estate appreciation tends to overcome inflation, which means that real estate investing provides hedge against inflation. And that’s why real estate is the best investment option, as it is the safest option for investing your money to avoid losing its value to inflation.

7. Accessible to everyone

In order to invest in stocks, you have to an expert in financial markets, which is no easy task. At the same time, anyone can become a real estate investor as it requires nearly no preliminary knowledge. All you have to have in order to start a real estate investment business is some common sense. Real estate investing is very much learning by doing, so you need to buy an income property and become a landlord in order to gain knowledge and experience. While investing in stocks can be very risky if you are not an expert, investing in real estate is generally safe even for beginners. And that is why real estate is the best investment strategy, even if you have no prior knowledge and expertise."
76,Misleading,"On 1 January 2017, this cryptocurrency's price stood at around $8.24.

At that time, its market cap was around $720 million.

Fast-forward to today, its market cap has grown past $30 billion. But even better, its price has soared to around $322 - which is a 3,807% return compared to Bitcoin's 453% return this year.

In other words, a R120 investment into this cryptocurrency on 1 January 2017, would have grown into over R4,500 today.

A R1,200 investment would have grown into over R45,600!

Today, Crypto experts say it has the potential to become the next Bitcoin. And smart investors who take the risk and invest, could become a millionaire.


The world’s most important system for future digital businesses
 
The developers of this cryptocurrency built a blockchain and a system that allows people to build businesses on their blockchain.
 
Author of The Crypto Revolution, Sam Volkering describes it as this…
 
""Think about a city. Full of skyscrapers with companies and people working away. You can imagine the blockchain as the land and the skyscrapers. Then you get the coin that powers the blockchain – it’s the same as the electricity that powers the city.""
 
The main purpose of this cryptocurrency’s blockchain was to build decentralised applications using a new digital protocol.
 
In simple terms, you can think of it as more of a platform for building applications, businesses and even new cryptocurrencies.
 
They achieve this using ‘smart contracts', which are ‘autonomous agents’ that operate on logic. Sam says…
 
For example, if A does B then C does D. These smart contracts can be far more complex than that. They can be as complex as to verify the identity of someone that might be applying for a new trading account.
 
Or they could be a smart contract to pay out a certain amount of money on the delivery of a particular product.
 
The key point is a smart contract can be used for anything. It can be fully automated and trusted. Thanks to the blockchain system and its decentralised nature it’s the perfect tool to build enterprise on.
 
The fact is, the more enterprises develop and build on this blockchain, the more powerful it gets.
 
The fuel that powers this blockchain
 
For this blockchain to survive and flourish and for enterprises to build on it, it needs ‘fuel’. The fuel is the coin that powers the blockchain.
 
Sam says…
 
""Think of this coin like a commodity. A limited resource that the whole system needs to use to work but is in limited supply. As the blockchain grows in size and stature and attracts major global corporations, the value of its fuel (the coin), should rise, and rise...and rise. The bigger it gets, the more it needs fuel, and those that hold the coin, and use it to help fuel the system could turn into millionaires, maybe even billionaires into the coming future.""
 
In short, bitcoin is a digital, decentralised currency for ‘the people’.
 
This cryptocurrency “could well be the supercharged ‘business version’ the world’s biggest companies will all come rely on.”
 
The good news is, despite this cryptocurrency growing over 3,800% in 2017, it’s just the beginning."
77,Misleading,"ou probably think of stocks, currencies, commodities, and bonds as the only items to invest and trade over exchange markets. But don’t be amazed and give me that odd look when I told you cryptocurrencies have emerged with a bang to trade over the exchange markets worldwide as well.

Cryptocurrencies are those items holding names such as “bitcoin” and “ethereum.” They are digital currencies that are computer generated using a decentralized system to bring forth a more stable currency. And the fact of the matter is people all over the globe are getting rich with these cryptocurrencies.

Today, there are over 984 digital currencies with more coming to the market every day.  With most of them having their status shooting higher and higher over and over again. And with their upcoming, they have provided a breeding ground for traders to make extra millions.

Cryptocurrency is a bunch of digital numbers generated by computers. Their primary purposes are to work as a channel of exchange using cryptography to create an environment that is more secure for transactions as well as the creation of additional units of digital currencies. Cryptocurrencies provide a more secure level of anonymity with transactions being irreversible and can’t be faked.

Cryptocurrencies use a decentralized system unlike other currencies controlled by centralized banking and other financial institutions, economic system, and governments. The decentralized system means digital currencies can be available to anyone, unlike centralized system which decides the clients they want to open accounts.

The first cryptocurrency is bitcoin which emerged in 2009, using blockchain technology application. And as a new channel of digital cash, cryptocurrencies markets have developed for small and large investors to trade and make huge money out of it.Cryptocurrencies are much equivalent to bonds and stocks. That’s why many of them are trading at huge discounts with a great opportunity for investors to grow wealthy very first.

If you have some savings lying around, you would be surprised what that cash can do for you. Few Euros, Dollars or your home currency worth of cryptocurrency can bring you fortunes. No brokers are charging high fees, nor any other middlemen to deal with. There are no barriers to market entry; it’s just amazing to make money any time you sport an opportunity.

To trade a cryptocurrency, one must be familiar with some knowledge regarding various businesses, consumer supply and demand, and the general economic trading at any moment.

Having this knowledge gives a massive advantage over other traders who are the early adopters of cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency miners, and programmers. These traders focus on a small technological innovation that indeed helps them to earn a profit without much thought of how the currency performs outside the exchange market.

With that said, let me walk you down on how to make a considerable profit margin using any cryptocurrency that you chose as your primary digital currency. First, you have to buy some cryptocurrency.  Many exchange markets are offering any purchase you wish to make. But, it’s a better idea to purchase bitcoin for new traders.

With bitcoin, you can trade any other cryptocurrency available in the market. The most significant advantage with bitcoin is that you can buy fractions of bitcoin called Satoshis instead of buying the whole unit.

Once you have your cryptocurrency, it’s time to find for an exchange. Some exchanges are best, others are bad. It’s up to you to do some research and choose that will not fail you. Don’t rush to those that will instantly shut down or have your cryptocurrency stolen. My advice for you is going to those exchange that has done exceptionally well since infancy.

Now, with cryptocurrency and exchange, you can start to trade. However, before you choose some cryptocurrencies to trade, it’s advisable to do research first. The best way to know how you will make the profit is by researching the coin to trade. So, before you go some trade have some information regarding that coin supply details, its current and future development plans, its performance within cryptocurrency community, and a lot more.

If you invest in a good coin for short-term or long-term, there is no hindrance from becoming a millionaire. You will walk around with your head high saying, “Damn! What an investment to plough me back millions.”'"
78,Misleading,"Why should beginners trade bitcoin to become millionaires?

The first cryptocurrency was introduced in 2009; the electronically mined currency Bitcoin has made it possible for every trader to make millions. With bitcoin, you can get productive with it using two ways: trade or mine.

But mining bitcoin has become extremely difficult. The pioneers of bitcoin engineered it in such a way that it becomes more difficult to mine it as time pass by. Turning on your computer to extract bitcoin will make it heat up and very noisy. And if you lucky enough to mine some bitcoin, it’s more likely you will have spent more on electricity bills.

The most realistic way of making millions worth of bitcoin is trading it in the most public prominent exchange markets. If you are that person who purchased bitcoins in 2011 when they were selling at lower prices, you are making a huge profit today. By then 1 bitcoin was worth $10 while today 1 bitcoin is worth $2800, making a $2790 profit is worth it.

Trading bitcoin is risky due to it high fluctuating price, but with the volatility there exists an opportunity. As long you have some capital with you to trade, you can convert it into millions.

The reason I recommend bitcoin to beginners is that it has a strong background and it’s here to stay. As earlier said, it does big favors for traders since you can buy it in fractions and trade it with any other cryptocurrency worldwide. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that comes into the market and die off, bitcoin has its existence 2009. Therefore, you should not worry if it’s your first cryptocurrency.

It’s important to note that bitcoin holds 50% of cryptocurrency market and it is, therefore, most performing currency today. Though, you can start with ethereum the second best from bitcoin.

 Things are changing first in the world of cryptocurrency. Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow is another universe of being a millionaire. If you have the feeling that there are no millionaires in the crypto world, then you are wrong. People are making money by making a rational decision.

How does it feel to wake up one day being a millionaire? Well, the feeling is incredible. Being a millionaire means resigning your day job and traveling the world within the next few weeks. It means having a luxury car, living in a mansion… the list is endless.Indeed, cryptocurrency can make you rich overnight."

A Closer Look at the Best Ways to Get Rich off Cryptocurrency
When learning how to get rich off crypto, it is important to understand the many different methods investors make money with cryptocurrency in 2023. 

It is also crucial to have a firm grasp of the underlying risks associated with each strategy. After all, it is not possible to get rich with crypto without taking an inherent level of risk. 

To find out more about how to get rich off crypto - read on. 

1. Investing in Presales - Buy Newly Launched Crypto Tokens at Presale Prices
When compiling this guide on how to get rich off crypto, we found that presales offer the overall best method to achieve this goal. For those unaware, presales - or ICOs, are offered to the public by newly launched blockchain projects. Each project will create its own native crypto asset that will then be sold to early investors. 

Investors are motivated to gain exposure to the respective presale for many reasons. 
First and foremost, this offers an opportunity to invest in a brand-new cryptocurrency while it is still in its infancy.
In turn, this means that discounted prices are offered to those that invest early. 
Second, many crypto presales come with staggered pricing. 
This means that after each tranche of crypto tokens is sold, the price gradually increases. 
Once again, this is an incentive for investors to get in as early as possible. 
Third, and perhaps most importantly, after the crypto presale has sold its allocation, the tokens will then be listed on an exchange. 
This is often the moment that the token takes off and enjoys a huge upside. 


The Dash 2 Trade presale is proving super popular, with more than $5.7 million raised in just three weeks. We like the underlying product being built by Dash 2 Trade - which is a crypto analytics dashboard. Think along the lines of the Bloomberg terminal - but instead of stocks and bonds - crypto assets. 

Dash 2 Trade is offering its D2T tokens at presale prices right now. The token will be required to pay for a monthly subscription to the Dash 2 Trade dashboard, which offers the full functionality of all supported features and tools. This includes fully-fledged crypto trading signals, which inform subscribers of which orders to place when an opportunity has been identified. 

For example, a signal might suggest buying BNB at $289, alongside a stop-loss of $265. Signals are derived from the team of in-house analysts at Dash 2 Trade, who combine independent technical and fundamental analysis with automated algorithms. The latter includes social media metrics that seek to find trending coins and presales. 


For example, there might be an upcoming presale being discussed heavily on Reddit. if this is the case, the Dash 2 Trade dashboard will inform its subscribers. Additional metrics available on Dash 2 Trade will include blockchain statistics, whale token movements, ICO ratings, new exchange listings, and more. 

The team of analysts at Dash 2 Trade will also run regular webinars and live event feeds. This is in conjunction with trading competitions, social tools, and even a backtesting facility. The latter enables Dash 2 Trade subscribers to create automated trading strategies but in a risk-free environment. 


Those that like the sound of the Dash 2 Trade analytics dashboard can buy D2T tokens right now via the presale. The presale is already in stage three and this means that each D2T token costs just $0.0513. The next stage will increase the price to $0.0533 for each D2T token. Nine stages will be executed in total before D2T tokens go live on a range of crypto exchanges. 

Ultimately, while no guarantees exist, those wondering how to get rich off crypto might consider the Dash 2 Trade presale as a highly notable opportunity that should not be missed.

IMPT - Carbon Credit Innovation via Blockchain Technology
Investors in the market for the most sustainable cryptocurrency that offers an attractive upside potential might wish to research the IMPT whitepaper. In fact, IMPT is revolutionizing a high-growth and emerging industry via blockchain technology - carbon credits. In a nutshell, carbon credits enable companies to emit carbon and other harmful gases into the atmosphere. 

Each year, companies are given an allocation of credits that can be used for this purpose. Should a company require additional credits, then they must be purchased via the open market. interestingly, companies like Tesla have a sizable surplus of carbon credit each year, considering the firm's green credentials. As such, Tesla can sell their excess carbon credits for cash. 

However, the key issue for smaller companies is accessing this market, not least because it is dominated by large-cap corporations. Furthermore, although carbon credits trade like gold or crude oil, accessing this market as a retail investor is also challenging. With this in mind, IMPT is building a global dashboard that will facilitate carbon credit trading in an inclusive manner. 


From the perspective of commerce, companies will be able to open an account with IMPT and buy the carbon credits they need at a fair, transparent price that reflects global spot rates. The process is simply a case of buying IMPT tokens which are then converted to carbon credits via NFTs. From the perspective of individual investors, the process is much the same. 

However, investors can keep hold of their carbon credit NFTs for as long as they wish. The idea here is to hold until carbon credit prices rise on the global stage and thus - a realizable profit can be made. In some jurisdictions, green investments also come with tax-efficient benefits. Another factor that makes IMPT the most energy-efficient crypto is that supports carbon offsetting. 

In simple terms, IMPT carbon credit NFTs can be 'burned', which means they are removed from the circulating supply. In turn, the stakeholder will offset their carbon emission footprint. And in doing so, the stakeholder will receive a new NFT that comes alongside unique digital artwork. Additionally, IMPT will also partner with online brands to offer cashback rewards - paid in IMPT. 

The IMPT presale has been running for a little over a month and has already raised in excess of $12.5 million. Stage two of the presale, prices each IMPT token at $0.023. The IMPT presale supports ETH and USDT and once sold out, the tokens will be listed on a crypto exchange that is yet to be announced.

Calvaria - The Future of Online Gaming via Crypto Rewards 
Calvaria could also be one of the best future cryptocurrency projects for a plethora of reasons. First and foremost, Calvaria is building a brand new gaming universe that follows a superb business model - play-to-earn. In its most basic form - and as the name suggests, play-to-earn games are built on blockchain technology and subsequently enable players to earn rewards. 

In the case of Calvaria, gaming rewards are earned and paid in the project's native crypto asset - RAI. Rewards can be earned and maximized by progressing through the Calvaria universe and subsequently defeating other players via a battle card strategy game. Each player will have their own unique battle cards that come with many different traits. 

Most importantly because each battle card is backed by an Ethereum NFT, players retain full ownership at all times. Furthermore, Calvaria will be launching a decentralized marketplace that enables players to buy, sell, and trade battle card NFTs - with pricing depending on demand and supply. 


Crucially, Calvaria will appeal to gamers that no longer wish to hand control of their in-game assets to the gaming developer. This is, unfortunately, the case with many popular games in the traditional space - such as FIFA 23 and Call of Duty. But with Calvaria, players can rest assured that all rewards are personally owned and retained. 

Another benefit of the Calvaria play-to-earn game is that its blockchain-based nature guarantees fairness. This means that card battle outcomes cannot be manipulated or predefined, either internally or externally. The best way to gain exposure to the growth of Calvaria is by investing in RAI tokens while the presale campaign is still ongoing. 

In a little under a month, Calvaria has raised more than $1.6 million from early investors and the campaign is now in stage four. For every 1 USDT invested in the presale, investors will receive 40 RAI tokens. However, once the presale swiftly moves into stage five, each USDT will get just 33.33 RAI.

2. Day Trading - Buy and Sell Crypto Throughout the Day to Make Regular Gains 
Now that we have covered presales, we can now move on to the next strategy to consider when learning how to get rich off crypto. One of the most popular tactics in this regard is to day trade crypto with the view of making small but frequent gains. The main concept is to speculate on the rise or fall of a specific crypto pair - such as BTC/USD. 

For example, if BTC/USD is priced at $19,500 - day traders will seek to determine whether this will increase or decrease within the coming hours or even minutes. Day traders never keep a crypto position open for more than a day - which in itself is a risk-management safeguard. But that begs the question - is it possible to get rich with crypto day trading?


Well, this all depends on the amount of capital that an investor has access to. If the day trader is entering positions with a small amount of money, then getting rich with cryptocurrency will be challenging. The only way around this barrier is to day trade crypto with leverage. Some exchanges in this space offer leverage of up to 100x. 

This means that for every $10 in the trader's account, a $1,000 position can be entered. This is why presales are arguably the best option when assessing how to get rich off crypto, as the upside potential is significantly higher when compared to restrictive day trading margins.

Your capital is at risk. Crypto asset investments are highly volatile and speculative.

3. HODLing - Invest in Crypto and Hold on a Long-Term Basis 
While day trading is somewhat limited in terms of the upside potential, this isn't the case with 'Hodling'. This is a crypto-centric term that refers to buying a digital asset and keeping hold of the investment for many months or years. Crucially, long-term investors will typically outperform speculative day traders in the long run. 

After all, by Hodling during an extended bull run, this can attract sizable gains. For example, in the most recent bull market, the likes of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu generated returns in the many thousands of percentage points. It is, however, important to do lots of research when selecting the best long-term cryptocurrency to buy. 


Many investors will elect to build a diversified portfolio that not only contains Bitcoin but many of the best altcoins in the market. The more diversified - the better. Once investors have assessed the best crypto to buy for long-term Hodling, the investment can then be initiated at eToro - which supports dozens of coins from a minimum trade size of just $10.

4. Staking and Interest - Earn Passive Income on Idle Crypto Holdings  
While staking and interest accounts will not necessarily enable investors to get rich, these methods are ideal for earning passive income during a bear market. Crucially, it is best to earn interest on cryptocurrencies rather than leaving the tokens to sit idle in a private wallet. Staking is perhaps the most popular option in this regard.

This investment product typically offers investors the choice of fixed or flexible terms. The latter enables investors to withdraw their cryptocurrencies at any time, albeit, the interest rate on offer will usually be lower. To get the highest interest rate possible, investors might consider a fixed term - which could be anything from 30 days to an entire year. 


The best staking platform in the market today is Quint. The reason for this is that Quint offers a unique feature called 'super staking'. In a nutshell, investors will first need to choose their preferred staking pool and each option will come with a prize - such as a BAYC NFT. The more that is staked, the more ticket entries that are given for the competition. 

While the competition period is ongoing, investors will receive staking rewards. Once the competition draw has been made, the winner will receive their prize. After that, all staking rewards can be withdrawn. The investor can then reallocate their tokens to enter the next competition draw while simultaneously earning passive income. 

5. Play-to-Earn Crypto Games - Earn Real-World Crypto Rewards by Playing Blockchain Games  
The next option to consider when exploring how to get rich off crypto is play-to-earn games. This concept enables players to earn cryptocurrencies simply for playing blockchain-based games. As noted earlier, a great example of this is Calvaria. 

To recap, those engaging with the Calvaria gaming ecosystem will have the chance to earn RAI tokens. In order to compete, players will first need to mint an NFT, which transitions into a set of battle cards. Each battle card is owned by the player and safely stored on the blockchain. 


The play-to-earn concept is especially attractive for those on a budget. The reason for this is that other than the initial cost of minting an NFT, the player will be required to dedicate time as opposed to money. As such, this represents one of the best ways to earn crypto with little capital.

6. Crypto Yield Farming & Lending - Generate Income by Loaning Crypto Tokens to Third Parties   
Another way to earn passive income is via crypto yield farming. This is a form of lending that promotes a variable rate of interest. In its most basic form, the first step is to choose a suitable crypto yield farming platform - which will likely be a decentralized exchange. 

After that, the investor will loan their cryptocurrencies to the exchange by connecting their private wallet. The respective tokens will then be used to fund a liquidity pool. This pool will then be used by traders to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on the decentralized exchange without an intermediary.


For providing the liquidity pool with cryptocurrency, the investor will earn a rate of interest that is often determined by the amount of trading fees collected. As such, this is a passive way to generate returns on idle crypto investments. 

7. Faucets - Complete Basic Tasks to Earn Free Crypto Tokens  
On the one hand, this strategy certainly won't enable investors to get rich from crypto. But once again - the best crypto faucets are worth considering for those that wish to get a foot in the digital asset space without risking any money. 

Put simply, crypto faucets are run by third-party websites that require people to complete super-basic tasks. As a prime example, this might be a requirement to download a new gaming app and play it for a number of minutes. 


Alternatively, the faucet might ask the user to complete a captcha form. Either way, the user will receive a tiny amount of crypto after completing each task. While the amounts on offer are small and inconsequential. Crypto faucets are essentially risk-free. 

8. Airdrops - Receive Crypto Tokens on a Fee-Free Basis   
In a similar way to faucets, airdrops enable beginners to earn free crypto without needing to risk any personal capital. Once again, the amounts on offer will be inconsequential. Most airdrops are offered by newly launched crypto projects. 

In return for completing tasks (like following the project on social media), free tokens will be sent to the user's wallet. Once the token is listed on an exchange, the user can then elect to sell the airdropped tokens. 


One of the most successful crypto airdrops of all time was the Bitcoin Cash fork in 2017. Anyone holding Bitcoin at the time would have received an equal number of Bitcoin Cash tokens. 

9. DAOs - Join a DAO and Help Make Important Project Decisions     
Decentralized autonomous organizations - or simply DAOs are a growing trend in the crypto space. In a nutshell, DAOs enable token holders of the respective project to vote in key decisions. For example, whether or not to upgrade the network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. 

Those holding a so-called governance token are essentially part-owners of the cryptocurrency project. And in turn, if the value of the token rises in the open marketplace, this will enable the holder to sell at a profit. 


However, do bear in mind that many DAO tokens have failed to live up to their initial expectations. As a result, the best approach to take when investing in DAOs is to build a diversified portfolio. 

10. Mining - Earn Crypto Rewards via Cloud Mining Platforms      
The final option to explore when evaluating how to get rich off crypto is crypto mining. This is a process that enables blockchain networks like Bitcoin to remain decentralized. In other words, miners are responsible for confirming transactions and ultimately - keeping the network safe. 

Miners are required to buy specialist hardware that connects to the blockchain, in addition to consuming vast sums of electricity. In turn, however, miners will receive crypto rewards when they are successful in validating a network block. 


The best way to target this space is via a cloud mining platform. The reason for this is that there is no requirement to buy any hardware or even consume electricity - other than what is required for an internet connection. 

Cloud mining platforms pool investor funds together to pay for the required hardware and operating costs and share rewards on a proportionate basis. This means that cloud mining offers a passive form of income. The first thing to consider when assessing how to get rich off crypto is the type of returns required. This will invariably be dependent on the amount of capital available to the investor. 

For example, with a starting balance of $100, established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum likely won't be suitable. This therefore raises the popular question 'is Bitcoin a good investment in 2023?'  
This is because it is very unlikely that these projects have the capacity to generate gains of 100x and more - considering that they already have multi-billion dollar valuations. 
With this in mind, those on a budget might instead consider crypto presales. Lucky Block, for example, generated gains of 60x after completing its presale in January 2022. Tamadoge was also successful, generating growth of 20x after its presale later on in the year. "
80,Misleading,"I have the benefit of 20/20 hindsight now, so there’s no way I’d pick the same coins. But we don’t get to use 20/20 hindsight in trading. We make a bet on a future that hasn’t happened yet.

First a quick refresher on this strategy. Remember, this isn’t a trading strategy, it’s a holding strategy. This is what I call it my “micro-VC strategy.” Venture Capitalists make money by investing in a bunch of companies with the full knowledge that 80% of their companies will end up worth absolutely nothing. That’s right. Zero. Nada. Zip.

It’s the last 20% where things get really interesting though. 10% become good earners and make their money back and then some. But the last 10% knock it out of the park. That’s where VCs make all their money. It’s those home runs that pay for everything else.

This is a counterintuitive approach for 95% of the people in the planet. How could you afford to get 80% of your picks dead wrong and still make money? But that’s exactly how probability works and it’s the strategy we’re using here.

So how did my picks do? What was on my original list?

if you ever need money just repeat"
81,v,"Then the price of gold will be $80,000 per ounce. S&P500 will be at $230,000. An average house price will be $9–10million. And the total M2 money supply will be $640trillion.

Unfortunately, the average salary will only be $340,000 (average salary was $9,800 in 1970, and is $60,000 today. This is a 3.55% average annual increase in average salaries from 1970 to today).

This is based on the observation that, since 1970 (the last year of the gold standard), M2 money supply grew from $590billion back then to over $20.8trillion today, which represents a 7.1% average annual rate of increase over 52 years.

Gold, stocks, and average house price have seen comparable average rates of appreciation at 7.8%, 7.9%, and 6.4%, respectively (in 1970, gold was $38/ounce, S&P500 was $83, and average house price was $17,000. Compared to today, gold is $1,900/ounce, S&P500 is $4,400, and average house price is $416,100).

You might think that these numbers are impossible in 50 years. But that’s exactly what your grandpa would have thought 52 years ago as well, yet here we are.

Why are the next 50 years different?

Because we have Bitcoin. Prior to Bitcoin, we only had gold, stocks, and real estate as a means of storing our value (and government bonds, which I discount). When Bitcoin’s true value is realized, it’s market cap will be among gold’s, stock’s, and real estate’s market cap.

If Bitcoin’s market cap was to approach and match the gold, stocks, real estate, or the dollar’s market cap within 50 years, then it’s conceivable that Bitcoin would be $20-$60million per coin, or more when considering that the rest of the world may also be using it. This would represent an average annual rate of appreciation of only 15-20% of Bitcoin over the next 50 years 
to reach this target and match the other main investment’s market caps that are growing at roughly 7% as well.

82,Misleading,"
Also known as refund scams, these scams target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either ""recovery agents"" or hackers. When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply advance-fee
 scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying. If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.




Humanity Coin Scam
Hello. I have a story to share. So there was I on the Twitter the other day, joining airdrops and stuff.. The usual, you know.

When all of the sudden, there I find this ""Humanity coin"" page, which supports fight against Human trafficking. Being really interested in supporting such an idea, I contacted the guy and we arranged a giveaway of his coin, on my Twitter page. He also did generously send 50,000 of this ""coin"" to my wallet address. But when I mentioned my associates hopefully joining in on this, he was quick to stop responding.

http://i66.tinypic.com/2jfk9ao.jpg

Well, that's when most people would stop even bothering. But it didn't stop me from doing some research about this little project myself. So, there is only one person involved. And there is no ""special software"" designed to expose the human traffickers online. This coin has no plans. It has ""infinite supply"", and a copy-paste page GuardHumanity.org, ran by the same person. Here's a print screen of this Website, along with some data from his ""white paper"".

http://i65.tinypic.com/2r77hna.jpg

I am very against human trafficking. And hope you do your research on this important subject. Same as I can't stand human trafficking, I also hate to see people trying to use this real human tragedy for personal benefit.


I was going through my Facebook feed and saw a post concerning investing with one FX Trader, The Facebook user said she invested $10,000 and got back 10times the amount in 5days, I decided to give it a try because the Offer was too good to reject, within a period of a month I had paid $20,000+ in total and each time I tried to withdraw they always ask me to pay for something else with the reason why I needed to pay to get my money and profit that had accumulated also telling me to refer someone before withdrawing my profit. I became tired and complained on a group luckily for me a user told me about a crypto recovery expert. I hesitated but then contacted him and he asked for the transaction history and details and within 7 hours they asked for my wallet address and sent me a whooping $20,000, I can't thank him enough. it's super incredible how you got mine back, you do all you can to help every victims!!! Just amazing, I applaud your ability to counter so many scammers with detailed measures and still be keeping it all cool without taking any credit from us, and if you already in one of this cases then you shouldn't hesitate to contact the recovery

84,Misleading,"If you want to profit from the growing use of Ethereum, there are several ways you can invest. The most direct option is buying Ethereum itself. Because it's extremely volatile, this carries the greatest risk but also the greatest potential profits. Another option is buying Ethereum stocks, including managed funds that invest in Ethereum for you and companies with large exposure to Ethereum technology.

What is Ethereum?
Ethereum is an open-source blockchain technology in the form of software. Software developer Vitalik Buterin originally proposed the idea in 2013, and Ethereum launched in 2015.

Any developer making an application that would benefit from blockchain technology can build it on the Ethereum network. While Ethereum is most associated with its native Ether token and other cryptocurrencies, its technology is also enabling widespread innovation in industries as diverse as insurance, logistics, and healthcare.

Developers write programs on Ethereum using self-executing, self-enforcing protocols called smart contracts, which are deployed to Ethereum-powered blockchains. The blockchain's network of computers executes the smart contract by performing specified actions when the conditions of the contract are met. Blockchain data can't be modified after it's created, and that gives users confidence in the technology.

Although early cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin, are merely stores of value that can be transferred, Ethereum has more uses. If Bitcoin is a smartphone app, Ethereum is more like the device maker. Ethereum's cryptocurrency benefits from its technology because transaction fees for decentralized applications on its blockchain are paid in Ether.

What is the Ethereum Merge?
The Ethereum Merge is the term for the network's switch from its original proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system, scheduled to occur in mid-September 2022.

When Ethereum launched, it used proof of work, the same system used by Bitcoin, to validate and record transactions. A notable drawback of this system is extremely high energy usage, which has led to Bitcoin using more power per year than some entire countries.

In 2020, Ethereum introduced the Beacon Chain, a proof-of-stake network. However, it continued using its original proof-of-work mainnet for processing transactions. The Merge is when Ethereum will combine the Beacon Chain with the mainnet and make the transition to proof of stake.

The primary benefit of The Merge is energy efficiency. Transaction speeds will change a small amount but not enough for most users to notice.

Top Ethereum stocks
Here are the best stocks to buy if you want to add Ethereum to your portfolio:

1. Grayscale Ethereum Trust
The Grayscale Ethereum Trust (OTC:ETHE) is a managed fund that makes it easy to add Ethereum to your brokerage account. Each share is backed by a fixed amount of Ether tokens (approximately 0.01 Ether per share).

Keep in mind that the fund's share price is often lower than the value of Ethereum at the prevailing conversion rate. Grayscale also charges a somewhat expensive annual management fee of 2.5%. Shareholders can't exchange shares for Ethereum, so there's no price arbitrage opportunity.

2. Bitwise Ethereum Fund
Bitwise is the world's biggest crypto index fund manager. It offers managed funds for multiple types of cryptocurrency, and one option is the Bitwise Ethereum Fund.

The fund is available to accredited investors and has a minimum investment of $25,000. The fund's managers seek to minimize transaction costs, and they hold the fund's Ethereum offline in cold crypto storage, making it a cost-efficient and secure Ethereum stock. There's an annual management fee of 1.5%.

If you want a more diverse digital asset portfolio, check out the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (OTC:BITW), which includes a mix of several of the top cryptocurrencies.

3. Coinbase
Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. The company charges transaction fees to buyers and sellers of a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. In addition to Ethereum, many other cryptocurrencies traded on Coinbase use the Ethereum blockchain.

The exchange rolled out Ethereum staking in 2021, allowing investors to lock up their Ether and earn rewards on it during the upgrade to a proof-of-stake system. Coinbase's staking program is expected to significantly benefit from the completion of The Merge. Analysis from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) predicts that Coinbase will generate $250 million to $600 million in additional revenue from Ethereum staking.

4. Staked ETH Trust
The Staked ETH Trust is the first traditional investment vehicle that allowed shareholders to get Ethereum exposure and receive staking rewards. It's open by private placement to accredited investors, with a minimum investment amount of $25,000 and an expense ratio of 1%.

Considering the attention that Ethereum staking is getting from The Merge, the fund could become very popular. The staking rewards allow the trust's underlying Ether holdings to grow about 7.5% annually, helping it to outperform non-staking funds.

The biggest advantage of the Staked ETH Trust is how much it simplifies staking for investors. You invest in it by buying shares, like any traditional investment vehicle, and the staking itself is handled by the fund administrator.

5. Robinhood Markets
Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) may be best known as the discount broker that ushered in the age of commission-free trading. That's not the only way it has been ahead of the game. In 2018, it began offering crypto trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The broker has since expanded its selection to include a few other cryptocurrencies, including Litecoin (CRYPTO:LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (CRYPTO:BCH). Although Robinhood isn't a pure cryptocurrency play, it does offer some exposure to Ethereum.

How to invest in Ethereum
If you want to directly invest in Ethereum, you can buy it through a crypto exchange, a stock broker, or even a payment app that carries it. Since Ethereum is one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, it's available on almost all platforms that sell crypto.

Here are the different types of platforms you can use to buy Ethereum:

Cryptocurrency exchanges: The exchanges let users buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Examples of popular crypto exchanges include Coinbase and Gemini.
Stock brokers: Some stock brokers have started selling select cryptocurrencies, with Robinhood being the most prominent example.
Payment apps: You can buy and sell crypto, including Ethereum, on PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Venmo, which is owned by PayPal.
For serious crypto investors, a crypto exchange is usually the best option. Exchanges offer the widest selection of cryptocurrencies and the most features. They also let you transfer your crypto off the exchange to a crypto wallet that you control. Stock brokers and payment apps often don't let you transfer your crypto anywhere.

Should you invest in Ethereum?
Ethereum technology is at the core of most blockchain applications. Many believe blockchain will play a significant role in the future of finance and other industries, making exposure to Ethereum technology a potentially profitable addition to your investment portfolio.

The value of Ether as a digital currency is much more volattile and unpredictable than the growth of Ethereum technology. You can mitigate some of that risk and should take steps to guard against hacking, but, ultimately, the value of any investment directly linked to Ether is likely to fluctuate.

Any of the above investment recommendations deserves consideration, especially if you believe that the development of blockchain technology is only just beginning.

85,v,"Cryptocurrencies have become one of the hottest asset classes on the market over the past year on the rise of everything from Bitcoin (BTC 3.17%) and Ethereum (ETH 3.61%) to Dogecoin (DOGE 3.47%). But there remains debate about the value and durability of cryptocurrencies and crypto stocks long term. 

There are lots of reasons investors are buying cryptocurrencies today. Some people think they're a store of value; others think they're the future of digital transactions. And bears think cryptocurrency has no utility or value at all. Whatever the future of cryptocurrency, one company that's built to win and grow from it is Square (SQ 2.05%).

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

Why Square wins if crypto is the future
The bullish case for cryptocurrency is that it becomes a commonly held asset class. Whether people are using it as a store of value, transaction currency, or simply for trading, Square will be a winner. The company's current role as a Bitcoin exchange market and custodial wallet allows it to generate significant profit from the spread on transactions. In the first quarter alone, Bitcoin transactions accounted for $3.51 billion in Square's revenue and $75 million in gross profit.

If Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency, does end up being a digital currency used for real-life transactions, Square could be set up to be the transaction platform of choice. People could pay for goods with crypto from the Cash App, and customers using Square's selling platform could accept crypto, potentially with lower transaction costs than using credit cards today. And Square could have dozens of cryptocurrency options on its platform for buyers and sellers. 

Crypto or not, I think the biggest upside for Square is that it upends the current financial-transaction infrastructure by replacing the banks and credit card companies that sit between buyers and sellers in the marketplace today. And if Square uses crypto to do that, it could be good for crypto and Square. 

Square wins if crypto has no future
If crypto is a fad or doesn't end up having any utility in our financial system, Square could still come out a winner. As big as Bitcoin seems for Square, it generated just $75 million in gross profit in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $964 million of gross profit for the company overall. Losing Bitcoin entirely wouldn't be the end of the world. 

At the same time, Bitcoin has helped bring millions of people into Square's Cash App platform, which is key to its two-sided financial platform. In March, Square said that 7 million Cash Cards were activated through the Cash App, and that's helping drive record cash inflows and profits for the app. 

On the consumer side, Square is trying to build the Cash App into the center of our financial lives. It can be used for deposits, transfers, stock investments, and Bitcoin. Even if Bitcoin goes away, Square is adding tens of millions of users to its Cash App who could eventually be banking or investment customers. And even if Bitcoin shrinks in importance, it has been key in attracting these customers to the platform. 

The best way to play crypto today
We saw over the past week that cryptocurrencies can go into a nosedive with little more than a tweet or two from powerful backers. And that should make any investor nervous about the future of crypto overall or any specific cryptocurrency. 

Whether you think the future is bright or bleak for cryptocurrencies, I think we have seen this year that Square is going to be able to benefit from this new asset class. Maybe crypto helps the company upend the financial system or maybe it just brings millions of people onto the Cash App. Either way, I think Square comes out of this crypto boom as a winner, and that's why it's the only way I'm betting on crypto today.

86,v,"It's easier than you may think to become a millionaire investor.
After a rough summer, cryptocurrency is making headlines yet again as Bitcoin (BTC 3.20%) recently reached a record high of $66,000 per token. While some early investors have made a lot of money investing in Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency, it's still a risky investment.

There are never any guarantees when it comes to the stock market, but crypto is still highly speculative at this point. Although many investors believe cryptocurrency is here to stay, nobody knows for certain how successful it will be over the long term.

This doesn't necessarily mean that cryptocurrency is a bad investment. If you're interested in crypto, it doesn't hurt to invest a small amount of money you can afford to lose. However, it's best to avoid going into it under the assumption that it will make you a millionaire.

There's one type of investment, though, that can make you a millionaire, and it's much less risky than cryptocurrency: S&P 500 ETFs.

Why invest in S&P 500 ETFs
An S&P 500 ETF is an investment that includes all the stocks within the S&P 500 index. These stocks are from some of the largest and most stable companies in the U.S., such as Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft.

Although all investments carry some degree of risk, S&P 500 ETFs are one of the safer options. These funds are designed to follow the stock market as a whole, and the market has historically earned positive returns over the long run.

This doesn't necessarily mean you'll earn positive returns each and every year. The stock market experiences short-term volatility, so while some years you may earn above-average returns, other years you may see losses. However, over the course of decades, those highs and lows will likely average out to a positive number.

^SPX Chart

^SPX DATA BY YCHARTS.

Despite its relatively low level of risk, the S&P 500 ETF is also a powerhouse investment. With the right strategy, it's possible to earn well over $1 million.

Becoming a millionaire with S&P 500 ETFs
The more time you allow your money to grow, the easier it will be to reach millionaire status with S&P 500 ETFs. By starting to invest now, you won't need to save as much each month to accumulate $1 million or more.

Historically, the S&P 500 itself has earned an average rate of return of around 10% per year. Again, this doesn't necessarily mean you'll earn 10% returns every single year, but if you keep your money invested for decades, your annual returns will likely average out to roughly 10% per year.

Let's say, for example, you can afford to invest $300 per month in S&P 500 ETFs. Assuming you're earning a 10% average annual return, here's how much you could accumulate over time:

NUMBER OF YEARS	TOTAL SAVINGS
10	$57,000
20	$206,000
30	$592,000
40	$1,593,000
SOURCE: CALCULATIONS BY AUTHOR VIA INVESTOR.GOV.

The more you're able to save each month, the more you'll earn over time. For instance, if you were able to invest $500 per month rather than $300 per month, you'd reach $1 million in just over 30 years. After 40 years, you'd have nearly $2.7 million saved.

Where to get started
If you're ready to get started investing in S&P 500 ETFs, you have plenty of options to choose from. Most S&P 500 ETFs are similar in many ways, and some of the most popular funds include:

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY 1.11%)
iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV 1.10%)
Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO 1.08%)
Cryptocurrency may be the trendiest new investment, but it's not right for everyone. While you can potentially make a lot of money with crypto, it can also be incredibly risky. S&P 500 ETFs are not only safer, but you also have a much better chance of building wealth over time."
87,Misleading,"The cryptocurrency sector reached a peak market value of $3 trillion in fall 2021. The sudden surge in value and rapid evolution created immense wealth for early crypto investors. As a result, there is huge interest in finding and investing in the next cryptocurrency unicorn.

With more than 20,000 different cryptocurrencies on the market -- and the world having been pushed further into the digital realm by the COVID-19 pandemic -- investing in technologies linking the digital blockchain space with society could be even more lucrative than guessing which token will become the next Bitcoin or Ethereum (ETH 3.62%). And there is no shortage of innovative companies trying to bridge the gap between the two.

Digital currency companies hold major potential
The original idea behind blockchain technology -- a digital ledger that automatically tracks transactions between parties and confirms ownership of a crypto asset -- was to create a borderless, peer-to-peer electronic cash payment system that's efficient and secure.

Investors can certainly purchase cryptos themselves, perhaps by buying small amounts of several different cryptocurrencies. But a better way to gain exposure to the sector is to invest in bigger and more established companies that benefit from the increased popularity of blockchain and crypto assets. The revenue that crypto service providers are deriving from blockchain tech has explosively grown over the past few years.

Companies that adopt blockchain technology, especially in finance, may gain a considerable edge over traditional competitors in processing payments. And brokers offering digital assets may attract more customers than exchanges offering traditional assets such as stocks and bonds.

However, the sector is subject to sharp market swings. Its peak value of $3 trillion slipped to less than $1 trillion in June 2022 as rising inflation drove many investors away from high-risk investments. This was not the crypto market's first gigantic plunge, and it probably won't be the last. Every investment is subject to risks, and you should only invest money you don't need in the short term. That guidance is even more important in the highly volatile crypto sector.

In keeping with that guidance, here are some of the best cryptocurrency stocks to consider:

1. Coinbase Global
Coinbase Global (COIN 3.85%), a top cryptocurrency trading exchange, made its initial public offering (IPO) in April 2021. The company is a popular platform for purchasing major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano (ADA 4.66%), allowing users to trade more than 250 altcoins.

The Coinbase platform’s success has been contingent on the increase in crypto prices, which in turn has led to millions of new users creating accounts. Coinbase earns a small transaction fee whenever someone buys or sells a cryptocurrency. But the company aspires to be more than just a place to trade. It also sponsors a debit card that allows consumers to spend from the balance in their digital wallet, and it’s launched a cloud platform for companies using and storing digital currencies.

Coinbase offers two game-changing innovations. The first is bringing the practice of asset loans -- which were previously only available to affluent investors -- to the masses. Users can pledge their Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as collateral and receive a low-interest loan to cover expenses. Using crypto as collateral means investors don’t have to sell their assets when emergencies arise, allowing their principal to continue compounding while they deal with matters at hand.

The second innovation is the rising adoption of Coinbase’s blockchain analytics by governments and financial institutions. Because most blockchains operate on a public ledger, the company can harness and monitor the data for illicit transactions and wallet addresses.

Suppose hackers managed to break through an individual's computer and demand ransom in the form of Bitcoin to unlock the machine. In that case, Coinbase could then match the hacker's wallet address with millions of know-your-customer (KYC) data points stored on its platform. This could help law enforcement track down the flow of funds and apprehend the cybercriminals -- building greater trust in the crypto space.

[Cryptocurrency] is a new asset class, but like real estate, there's only so much Earth. So it's defined, and therefore this moving price of the commodity is just how much, within this finite class of a commodity, this new asset class, how much people value it or want it.

2. Block and PayPal Holdings
At the heart of every digital payment protocol is the absence of central intermediaries (and therefore, lower costs for businesses and consumers). So Block (SQ 2.05%) (formerly Square) and PayPal (PYPL 1.28%) saw a meaningful business opportunity in enabling users to purchase and hold cryptocurrencies within a digital wallet.

In late 2017, Block’s Cash App consumer-facing application began allowing Bitcoin trading. In 2020 and 2021, Bitcoin was a huge revenue generator for Block, although the trading feature did little to help the company’s bottom line.

However, the company is helping to foster the use of Bitcoin among its business users (through the Block ecosystem), and it could become a top platform for crypto transactions between companies and their customers. This is especially promising for disrupting traditional international transactions in which banks often charge hefty foreign exchange fees. Cash App added support for the Bitcoin Lightning network in April 2022, allowing customers to transfer Bitcoin much faster and without transaction fees. CEO Jack Dorsey said the feature will “increase the usability of Bitcoin all toward an open global monetary transmission network the world can trust.”

PayPal’s Venmo digital wallet and peer-to-peer payments app, which unlocked crypto trading in early 2021, offer a similar mix of simple banking features and mass-market crypto-trading tools. At the launch, Venmo supported the trading of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH 6.21%), Ethereum, and Litecoin (LTC 2.87%). With the most users of any peer-to-peer money movement app, Venmo could become a leading cryptocurrency platform with its new feature. It serves as a solid access point for investors who wish to buy major cryptocurrencies and then use them to purchase altcoins or access decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

3. Canaan and Hut 8 Mining
Bitcoin mining has changed dramatically over the past few years. These days, companies such as Canaan (CAN 4.93%) design high-powered, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) machines specifically for the purpose of brute-force guessing the network's correct hash (passcode). Canaan's next-generation Avalon ASICs can make tens of trillions of guesses every second for the right hash to validate blocks on the Bitcoin network, which is millions of times more powerful than AMD (AMD 3.57%) and Nvidia's (NVDA 3.17%) latest graphics processing units (GPUs) for this hyper-specific purpose. Sales have been skyrocketing due to the device's affordability and relatively low energy consumption, meaning greater profits for miners.

One of the most popular Bitcoin mining stocks is Hut 8 Mining (HUT 6.9%). The company, based in Canada, commands a sizable minority stake on the overall Bitcoin network, and it generates very strong cash flows compared to revenue. Instead of selling the Bitcoin it mines on the market, Hut 8 Mining maximizes returns for shareholders by lending them out and farming yields, leading to compounded returns. Furthermore, investors can be assured that environmental concerns regarding the practice won't hold the company back. Hut 8 Mining uses a mix of wind, solar, and natural gas sources for its electricity, with decade-long leases.

4. Nvidia and AMD
Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD don’t deal with cryptocurrencies directly, but the two semiconductor companies are the leading designers of graphics processing units (GPUs). Best known for powering high-end video game graphics, GPUs now enable computing-intensive applications such as data centers, artificial intelligence, and the creation of crypto assets.

Cryptography and blockchain creation require immense computational power, and GPUs are well-suited for the job. Back in 2018, booming cryptocurrency prices were a driving force for Nvidia and AMD stock price increases as digital currency miners (people using their computers to create new units of digital assets) scrambled to purchase GPUs for the task. GPUs remain a fundamental piece of hardware for creating and managing crypto assets. Nvidia even launched a new lineup of chips specifically for crypto mining in early 2021.

Both Nvidia and AMD look to further cement their positions as leaders in chip technology through acquisitions. Nvidia recently tried to purchase ARM Holdings, which licenses chip architecture design for data centers and smartphones, and AMD wanted to acquire field-programmable chip leader Xilinx. Nvidia had to give up on its ARM deal, but AMD completed its Xilinx buyout in February 2022. With or without the acquisitions, Nvidia and AMD are poised to continue taking market share of the semiconductor industry and are leading the way in developing more emerging technologies such as blockchain ledgers.

5. Meta Platforms and Shopify
Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META 2.31%) attempted to develop a new cryptocurrency called Diem (formerly Libra). Diem was envisioned as a global financial payment and infrastructure platform accessible to everyone, including almost one-third of the global population without bank accounts.

The project had some setbacks, including losing Visa (V 0.72%), Mastercard (MA 0.81%), and PayPal from its consortium of high-profile members. Government regulators expressed skepticism about Diem since cryptocurrency is still largely unregulated, and Meta eventually sold its control of Diem for $200 million. Nevertheless, work on the project is continuing under the new ownership, and Meta is reportedly considering different options for entering the cryptocurrency market. The company certainly wants to control part of the blockchain infrastructure behind its ambitious Metaverse vision.

E-commerce infrastructure and software provider Shopify (SHOP 5.13%) allows merchants using its platform to accept cryptocurrencies as payment. It recently deepened its capability by integrating with cryptocurrency payments processor CoinPayments. In the spring of 2020, Meta’s Facebook Shops was announced as a new offering for small business e-commerce, with Shopify as a third-party software provider powering the new online stores. Together, Meta and Shopify are primed to benefit if the adoption of digital assets continues among small businesses and entrepreneurs.

6. Robinhood Markets
Robinhood Markets (HOOD 1.16%) is a popular discount brokerage app that allows users to buy stocks, options, rare metals, and now, cryptocurrencies. Investors can buy and sell more than a dozen cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin (DOGE 3.49%), commission-free on the platform 24/7. The company already holds billions of dollars in crypto assets under custody, with crypto trading revenue now comprising a significant portion of overall sales.

Robinhood can combine its commission-free model with scaling the number of cryptocurrencies on the platform, gaining a massive competitive advantage over both traditional and decentralized exchanges. The company also could offer the same crypto analytics services as Coinbase to further promote trust in the sector and boost its adoption.

7. CME Group
CME Group (CME 0.63%) operates the world’s largest financial derivatives exchange allowing investors to trade futures, which bet on the future price of an asset, and options, which grant investors the option to sell or buy an asset in the future at a predetermined price. CME Group's exchange trades a diverse assortment of assets, including agricultural and mining products, energy, stocks, and currencies. It’s the latter that makes CME Group a crypto stock.

At the end of 2017, CME established the first market for Bitcoin futures. At the start of 2020, the company created a market for options on Bitcoin futures. As of March 2022, Ether (units of the crypto platform Ethereum) also had futures available on the exchange. Both Ether and Bitcoin futures were joined by micro futures this year, based on smaller slices of the underlying cryptocurrencies.

Establishing a full-featured exchange for derivatives of the best-known cryptocurrencies has given Bitcoin and Ethereum some extra legitimacy and provided a way for digital currency owners (both individuals and a growing list of businesses that accept cryptocurrencies as payment) to mitigate risk from changes in cryptocurrency prices. Cryptocurrency derivatives are still a small market for CME Group, but adding more exchanges for crypto assets in the future is possible -- and even likely."

Real estate investments are often a great way to earn higher-than-average returns while also diversifying your portfolio. Some suggest real estate investing, when done appropriately, is the highest-earning asset class a portfolio can have. Let’s look at some of the reasons to investigate real estate investing as an opportunity to grow capital.

1. It’s one of the safest investments you can make.

Real estate investing is safe and secured by the asset itself — the building. Rarely will you see your investment lose value and if so, it’s usually only for a short period of time. Unlike fiat currencies like the dollar, real estate doesn’t lose value to inflation year after year — it performs better. Smart investors can even set themselves up well in down markets by buying value-add assets such as many did after the housing bubble burst in 2008.

2. There are multiple ways of investing in real estate.

In today’s digital-savvy world, it has never been easier to invest in real estate. With syndication groups introducing new and innovative ways to invest in all kinds of property, such as multifamily apartments and the likes, you’ll have plenty of options to choose from in this investment class.

3. There are several ways this asset class appreciates in value.

With real estate investing, your asset not only appreciates naturally with the market, but you can also force appreciation. Think of it like this: Natural appreciation occurs over time as the general market for real estate inflates. Forced appreciation is the revenue that can be made from the money you put in. New windows? That’ll bring in value. Just got the roof re-done or renovated some interiors? That raises your selling price, too. The reason for this is as you renovate, you can increase the rents and the increase in rents forces the value up. There are many things you can do to force the appreciation of your property and this can make real estate investing a real cash cow.

4. It can diversify your portfolio.

Many people never invest, and the ones who do rarely venture from the stock market. Perhaps this goes without saying, but the most successful investor is always the most diversified, as well. It doesn’t matter if you are an accredited or non-accredited investor, you can still invest in this asset class. It’s no coincidence that those who diversify have the most chances at success long-term.

5. Real estate investors generally pay fewer taxes.

The government loves real estate investors. Why? Because they develop society by developing land for the public. Because of this, they tend to look favorably toward real estate investors come tax season.

Here are a few of the breaks you can expect:

• Property tax deductions

• Travel costs associated with your investment

• Cost of repairs and maintenance

• Depreciation deduction/Cost segregation study

• Legal and management services deductions

6. You can get easy access to loans.

Banks are nice to real estate investors, too. As long as you have reliable credit, a consistent job, some experience or a qualified sponsor, you can expect to get a loan from the bank, often at a reasonable interest rate. Depending on interest rates at the time of purchase, you may also have several options when choosing the length of your mortgage.

7. It can be passed down through generations.

Real estate is a tangible investment. It is one of the easiest asset forms to pass down from generation to generation. Many people like the fact that they can leave their property in their will for their children and, in some cases, defer some of the taxes.

8. You can earn passive income.

This is one of the best reasons to invest in real estate: passive income. That’s right, there are dozens of ways you can turn a real estate investment into passive income while a property manager or sponsor does the heavy lifting. Whether you are the sole owner or you are a part of a syndication group, passive income is normally the goal of any true real estate investor.

Real estate investing is one of the best-performing asset classes out there. Year after year, it yields some of the highest returns in any portfolio. Do it right, and you could end up retiring well before you ever considered possible.
"
89,Misleading,"The debate about which is the best type of investment is as old as anyone can remember. However, even for the firm stocks aficionados, it is hard to refute the fact that real estate investing is the safest investment option around, which consequently makes it also the best one. Here are 7 reasons why real estate is the best investment, being the safest one.

1. Investing in land

Investing in real estate automatically means investing in land as well. Actually land can be quite a big chunk of your real estate investment, sometimes reaching well beyond 50% of the total amount. The best quality of land from a real estate investor’s point of view is that it is a limited resource. There is no way to make more land that what is already available (except for the very expensive method of land reclamation from ocean, sea, or river beds). This means that the price of land is set to keep going up indefinitely into the future, regardless of the general economic conditions. As a result, the total value of your real estate investment will also continue increasing in the long term. In addition, you can always use the land on which your income property is built to build a new, bigger property, which will generate more rental income for you; for example, you can replace a single-family property with a multi-family home. Last but not least, you can always leave land as inheritance for your children and grandchildren. So, the first reason why real estate is the best investment is because a large portion of it is investing in land, which is extremely safe.

2. Investing in tangible assets

The next reason why real estate is the best investment strategy is the fact that when you invest in real estate, you actually buy a tangible asset – an income property. While no market is insured against a collapse, including the real estate one, you will always have something physical in case you choose to invest in real estate. Let’s say that in the worst case scenario you can’t find tenants to rent your rental property to or rents are so low it does not make sense to rent out, you can still turn your income property into your primary home or you can sell it to make profit. On the other hand, if you lose money when investing in stocks, you will be left with nothing. That’s why real estate is the best investment option.

3. Real estate markets are relatively stable

In comparison with stock markets, real estate markets are quite stable. Stock markets are highly volatile, which means that you can make lots of money or alternatively lose lots of money within a few days or even hours. While the real estate market is also subject to some volatility, it is significantly less than in the case of stocks. This means that there is less risk associated with investing in real estate, which makes this type of investment safer. And safer investments are better investments. So, that’s reason #3 why real estate is the best investment possible.

4. Long term appreciation

As we said above, real estate markets are generally considered to be stable. Nonetheless, the overall long-term trend is that prices will always go up. Even if income property prices don’t increase significantly every single year in a particular city or neighborhood, long-run appreciation is a fact in real estate investing. If you buy an investment property today, you will definitely be able to sell it for more in 10- or 15-year time. One of the main drivers of rental property prices, as highlighted in point 1, is the fact that every single income property is built on some land, and land is a very limited resource. So, real estate appreciation is the 4th reason why real estate is the best investment, as it is the safest investment strategy in the long term.

5. Regular income

However, investing in real estate does not have to bring you profit in the long term only. Indeed, most investors purchase investment properties to make money in the short term, through positive cash flow. Regardless of how big or small your income property is, it will generate some monthly rental income for you, provided that you are able to rent it out to tenants, of course. Any smart real estate investor will only go for a rental property which provides more rental income than recurrent costs, meaning that it creates positive cash flow. In this sense, investing in real estate is quite different from investing in stocks, which do not guarantee to make moneyevery month or not even every year. The fact that income properties provide regular income is another reason why real estate is the best investment strategy, both in the short and in the long run.

6. Hedge against inflation

Inflation is a fact – i.e., the general price level goes up over time even if some prices drop down from one month to another. Real estate investing, thus, is an excellent protection against inflation. Even though all prices go up with time, the prices of investment properties go up more rapidly. That is to say that real estate appreciation tends to overcome inflation, which means that real estate investing provides hedge against inflation. And that’s why real estate is the best investment option, as it is the safest option for investing your money to avoid losing its value to inflation.

7. Accessible to everyone

In order to invest in stocks, you have to an expert in financial markets, which is no easy task. At the same time, anyone can become a real estate investor as it requires nearly no preliminary knowledge. All you have to have in order to start a real estate investment business is some common sense. Real estate investing is very much learning by doing, so you need to buy an income property and become a landlord in order to gain knowledge and experience. While investing in stocks can be very risky if you are not an expert, investing in real estate is generally safe even for beginners. And that is why real estate is the best investment strategy, even if you have no prior knowledge and expertise."

93,Not Misleading,"It’s no secret that the pandemic brought a wave of new investors eager to give a shot at playing the market.

In fact, a Charles Schwab study found that 15% of all current U.S. stock market investors got their start in 2020 — giving rise to what Schwab calls the “Investor Generation.”

The pandemic prompted the perfect timing to begin investing: stocks became cheaper to buy as the market dipped, savings account interest rates got slashed in half and many young consumers were stranded at home with nothing much else to do.

Plus, now that many brokerage firms now offer accounts with no minimums and zero-commission trading, just about anyone can start investing, even with a small amount of money.

To help guide this new generation of investors, as well as their more experienced counterparts, Select spoke with a handful of certified financial planners about what to watch out for.

Here are the seven biggest investing mistakes they say are the most common.

Constantly watching the markets
Chasing the trends
Following bad advice from social media
Not giving your investments time to grow
Investing money you’ll soon need
Having unclear investing goals
Delaying investing altogether
Mistake 1: Constantly watching the markets
Of all the mistakes we heard, this one came up the most.

“I have told many clients to turn off their TVs and stop watching the daily market news,” Danielle Harrison, a Missouri-based CFP at Harrison Financial Planning, tells Select.

While it’s normal (and generally advised) to keep an eye on what’s happening in the overall economy, it’s easy to get swept up in the excitement or doom and gloom of it all. The markets are constantly moving and trying to follow along in real-time can lead you to continuously checking or changing your investments when you’re better off leaving them alone for the long haul.

“You’re likely to perform worse than if you just stuck with your original strategy in the first place,” says Douglas Boneparth, a New York City-based CFP, president of Bone Fide Wealth and co-author of The Millennial Money Fix. Viewing negative performance without context can lead to rash decision making, while positive performance can instill overconfidence, explains Joe Lum, a California-based CFP and wealth advisor at Intersect Capital.

Lum agrees that it’s best for investors to avoid tracking their performance (both good and bad) too frequently. While it’s easier than ever to get instant information on your portfolio’s progress, it doesn’t mean it’s necessary.

“If we were running a marathon, it wouldn’t make sense to track our mileage in quarter-mile increments,” Lum says. “The same can be said about long-term investing, particularly in retirement accounts which traditionally have the longest time horizon.”

Before investing, Boneparth suggests asking yourself, “Can I hold these positions for a long period of time?”

“Investing should be boring,” Harrison says. Her advice? Look at your investments on a quarterly basis, which should be more than enough for most investors.

Mistake 2: Chasing the trends
Whether it be participating in a frenzy over GameStop stock, which we all saw back in January, or investing in the newest cryptocurrency, chasing the trends is a common mistake investors make.

Lauryn Williams, a Texas-based CFP and founder of Worth Winning, says she sees investors follow the next hot stock not knowing why they are choosing a particular investment other than the fact that “someone else says it is awesome.”

“A lot investors make the mistake of chasing trends or what’s cool because of FOMO,” Boneparth adds. He recommends always doing your due diligence before putting your money in the market. Or, as another option for a more hands-off approach, invest passively in the markets through index funds and watch your portfolio grow over time. By using your brokerage account to buy diversified mutual and index funds, you take on less risk than when you buy an individual company’s stock.

The best free stock trading platforms
Select reviewed over 12 online brokers that offer zero-commission trading and narrowed down the top six platforms for all sorts of investors: TD Ameritrade; Ally Invest; E*TRADE; Vanguard; Charles Schwab; and Fidelity.

These six offer the widest ra


Mistake 3: Following bad advice from social media
“I cringe at the misinformation out there surrounding investing and finances in general, especially on social media,” Harrison says.

The overall guidance from experts is simple: Don’t take investment advice from those who don’t know your personal financial situation. For example, you may feel pressured by someone on social media to start investing in a certain company, but they aren’t clued in to what other investment options you may have. You may be better off putting that money in your employer-sponsored retirement account, especially if your company matches contributions up to a certain percentage of your salary.

Make sure to do your own research when investing and read up on the person giving financial advice on TikTok or another social-media platform. Whether you are just starting out or you’re a more seasoned investor, a good place to begin is with FINRA’s free e-learning program for investors.

Mistake 4: Not giving your investments time to grow
When it comes to investing, time is important. Ideally, you should hold investments for as long as you can to maximize your returns. “Investing is something you do with the expectation of reasonable returns over a long-term period,” Harrison says.

A big mistake Williams sees is investors bailing out on an investment because they did not double their money in a certain period of time, which is usually days or weeks.

“If you need your money to grow urgently, you probably don’t have proper savings,” she says. “Quick growth comes with a lot of risk.” More about this in Mistake No. 5 below.

Mistake 5: Investing money you’ll soon need
People jumping into the markets before building themselves a strong financial foundation is the biggest mistake Boneparth sees investors make.

Prior to investing, you should feel in control of how you spend your money. A big part of that is building a cash reserve so you don’t need to rely on your investments when you run into an emergency or want to make a certain purchase.

“The stock market can be volatile, and you’d hate to lose the money you were saving for something like a down payment on a home you were wanting to purchase,” Harrison says.

A good way to know if you’re ready to invest is understanding if you have a healthy amount of cash in a savings account set aside for all your near-term goals. Harrison suggests that money needed within a relatively short time period, such as within three years, should not be invested in stocks.

Mistake 6: Having unclear investing goals
Once you have a separate savings net set aside that you can fall back on, make sure you have clear goals as you go into investing.

Harrison warns that investing to make more money is rarely the goal. Instead, people should see money as a tool for meeting their other goals. Making investing all about returns is a common mistake she sees.

“You don’t have to chase high returns that also correlate with higher risk, if you can adequately meet your goals with less risky investments,” Harrison says.

Many investors use the S&P 500 as a benchmark for their investment performance, but Lum points out that this index is often not a fair comparison against individuals’ actual portfolios.

“While the S&P 500 serves as an easy proxy for how ‘the market is doing,’ it is important to remember that the design of your portfolio and performance should be aligned to meet your goals — not an index that doesn’t know your financial situation, goals or time horizon,” Lum says.

Mistake 7: Delaying investing altogether
Lastly, choosing to never invest at all is a costly mistake. Keeping all your cash in a bank account means that money loses its purchasing power due to the rising rate of inflation.

“Some people are so scared of investing that they never even begin and lose out on the amazing compounding effect that can happen over the long term,” Harrison says.

INVESTING IN YOUR VALUES

Discover strategies for becoming a savvy and confident investor, even during turbulent times.

It seems everyone’s jumping into the investing game these days. In fact, the percentage of individual investors in the U.S. equity trading volume jumped up 4% in 2020.1 And events like the GameStop short squeeze in early 2021 have drawn even greater attention.

If you’re interested in investing, it’s important to know that everyone makes mistakes—but you can learn from the mistakes of others to help avoid making them yourself. This can help you build confidence when it comes to investing, giving you positive momentum for reaching your long-term goals.

Get started on your investing journey with these tips for avoiding some of the most common mistakes.

Mistake No. 1: Putting all your eggs in one basket
They say variety is the spice of life. Diversification has always been a byword of a healthy portfolio—and it’s also a way to help alleviate the stress of market turbulence. What you’re trying to avoid is putting too much of your money in one company or asset, an action that has been the downfall of many investors. If you’re properly diversified, it’s not as big a deal if one of the assets in your portfolio doesn’t perform.

In the past, diversification may have meant including a mix of stocks and bonds among your assets. Now, “one of the best ways to diversify is through investing in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs),” says Brian Ford, Truist’s head of financial wellness.

These types of funds, which are put together by teams of experts, take a lot of the guesswork out of picking stocks. You can easily diversify by choosing a variety of funds, such as ones that focus on small or large companies (often referred to as small-cap or large-cap stocks, respectively), foreign stocks, or even specific sectors, like energy or consumer goods. ETFs such as those benchmarked to the S&P 500 are extremely popular for their consistent, steady growth. 

Mistake No. 2: Not thinking big picture
When investing, play the long game. It’s important to know why you’re investing and to keep your eyes set on your long-term goals.

“When COVID-19 hit and the market took a dive, our natural inclination was to think, ‘Should I just cut my losses now and sell?’” says Ford. But in 2020, that kind of short-term thinking would’ve landed an investor in a disadvantaged position, as the market took a surprising upturn. Don’t focus on immediate returns, advises Ford, but rather on where you might want to be a few years from now—or even later in life.

Consider what you’re investing for, in addition to what you’re investing in, adds Bright Dickson, Truist’s resident expert on positive psychology. For example, if you’re passionate about climate change and conservation, you can align your values with your investments, and consider environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing.

“Money is simply a conduit to what we really want in life, so keep your eye on those goals and values,” she says. 

Mistake No. 3: Letting emotions drive decision-making
“Emotions and investing are like oil and water: They don’t really mix,” Ford cautions.

For example, people see the market skyrocketing, “and they get financial FOMO—they start buying at inflated prices because they don’t want to miss out on the party.”

On the other hand, people may see the market tanking and decide to sell, but that’s typically counterproductive for the long term.

One way to prevent the common investing mistake of emotional decision-making is to acknowledge your feelings, know that they’re normal, and then work to calm or counteract them. Simply looking at your portfolio less might help. Remind yourself that it’s normal for the market to have peaks and valleys. And if you do find you’ve already made a mistake—like buying a stock or fund at a high price and watching it lose money—don’t beat yourself up.

“Instead of getting down on yourself, identify that negative self-talk and ask yourself, ‘Can I learn from this instead of getting upset with myself?’” suggests Dickson. 

Mistake No. 4: Investing inconsistently
Slow and steady wins the race. Avoid worrying about the ups and downs of the market—instead, commit to a consistent investing strategy like dollar-cost averaging, says Ford. With dollar-cost averaging, you put a fixed amount of money into the market at regular intervals, such as weekly, biweekly, or monthly.

“That means putting money into your 401(k) every month, regardless of whether the market’s doing really well or poorly,” Ford says. “This allows you to avoid emotional buying or selling, because you’re putting the same amount of money in consistently, month in and month out, whether the market is overheated and overpriced or undervalued.”

You never know what the market is going to do next month, but by investing at regular intervals, you’re buying both the ups and the downs, which helps average the cost of your investments. 

Mistake No. 5: Not talking with experts
Finally, a great way to ease your mind when it comes to avoiding investing mistakes is to work with a trusted expert, like a financial advisor.

“Everyone needs a coach—the best athletes in the world have coaches,” Ford says. “A financial advisor is not going to give you all the answers and do the work for you, but they’ll provide you with some guidelines. And when you’re losing your mind because the market’s going down and you call your financial advisor, they’ll remind you to relax and focus on the long term.”

Investing is an important tool for building financial confidence, which can have a direct impact on your overall well-being. Put these tips into practice, and you’ll find it a little less intimidating."

Investing wisely requires avoiding pitfalls that can hinder your progress. This article provides you with a strategic guide to sidestepping common investment mistakes and setting a course for financial prosperity.

**1. Ignoring Research:** Lack of thorough research can lead to poor decisions. Prioritize understanding the assets you're investing in.

**2. Emotional Impulses:** Allowing emotions to dictate investment choices can result in impulsive decisions. Base your decisions on logic and analysis.

**3. Operating Without a Plan:** Investing without a well-defined plan is like driving without directions. Craft a clear strategy tailored to your goals and risk tolerance.

**4. Neglecting Diversification:** Overconcentration in a single asset exposes you to unnecessary risk. Spread your investments across diverse assets to safeguard your portfolio.

**5. Timing the Unpredictable:** Successfully timing the market is challenging. Focus on long-term goals rather than trying to predict short-term fluctuations.

**6. Chasing Quick Profits:** Pursuing short-term gains often causes investors to overlook solid long-term opportunities.

**7. Underestimating Fees:** High fees can eat into your returns over time. Be mindful of management fees and transaction costs linked to your investments.

**8. Blindly Following Trends:** Following trends without proper analysis can lead to uninformed decisions. Conduct thorough research before making choices.

**9. Impatience:** Impatience can lead to premature selling or excessive trading, which may hinder long-term growth.

**10. Neglecting Long-Term Goals:** Reacting to short-term market movements can divert attention from your long-term investment objectives.

**11. Overemphasizing Past Performance:** Past performance is not a guarantee of future success. Evaluate investments based on their current fundamentals.

**12. Borrowing Beyond Limits:** Overleveraging through borrowing can amplify losses and increase financial stress.

**13. Ignoring Portfolio Monitoring:** Neglecting regular portfolio reviews can result in missed opportunities or holding onto underperforming assets.

**14. Overconfidence:** Overestimating your ability to beat the market can lead to excessive risk-taking and potential losses.

**15. Skipping the Emergency Fund:** An emergency fund provides a safety net, reducing the need to withdraw investments in times of crisis.

**16. Neglecting Tax Efficiency:** Disregarding tax implications can lead to higher tax bills and diminished overall returns.

**17. Frequent Trading:** Excessive trading can increase costs and impede the benefits of long-term compounding.

By steering clear of these common investment mistakes, you can chart a more secure path towards your financial goals. Embrace a continuous learning mindset, remain disciplined, and remember that successful investing is a journey of growth and refinement."
97,Not Misleading,"t happens to most of us at some time or another: You're at a cocktail party, and ""the blowhard"" happens your way bragging about his latest stock market move. This time, he's taken a long position in Widgets Plus.com, the latest, greatest online marketer of household gadgets. You discover that he knows nothing about the company, is completely enamored with it, and has invested 25% of his portfolio hoping he can double his money quickly.

You, on the other hand, begin to feel a little smug knowing that he has committed at least four common investing mistakes. Here are the four mistakes the resident blowhard has made, plus four more for good measure.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Mistakes are common when investing, but some can be easily avoided if you can recognize them.
The worst mistakes are failing to set up a long-term plan, allowing emotion and fear to influence your decisions, and not diversifying a portfolio.
Other mistakes include falling in love with a stock for the wrong reasons and trying to time the market.
1. Not Understanding the Investment
One of the world's most successful investors, Warren Buffett, cautions against investing in companies whose business models you don't understand. The best way to avoid this is to build a diversified portfolio of exchange traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds. If you do invest in individual stocks, make sure you thoroughly understand each company those stocks represent before you invest.

2. Falling in Love With a Company
Too often, when we see a company we've invested in do well, it's easy to fall in love with it and forget that we bought the stock as an investment. Always remember, you bought this stock to make money. If any of the fundamentals that prompted you to buy into the company change, consider selling the stock.

3. Lack of Patience
A slow and steady approach to portfolio growth will yield greater returns in the long run. Expecting a portfolio to do something other than what it is designed to do is a recipe for disaster. This means you need to keep your expectations realistic with regard to the timeline for portfolio growth and returns.

4. Too Much Investment Turnover
Turnover, or jumping in and out of positions, is another return killer. Unless you're an institutional investor with the benefit of low commission rates, the transaction costs can eat you alive—not to mention the short-term tax rates and the opportunity cost of missing out on the long-term gains of other sensible investments.

5. Attempting to Time the Market
Trying to time the market also kills returns. Successfully timing the market is extremely difficult. Even institutional investors often fail to do it successfully. A well-known study, ""Determinants Of Portfolio Performance"" (Financial Analysts Journal, 1986), conducted by Gary P. Brinson, L. Randolph Hood, and Gilbert L. Beebower covered American pension fund returns. This study showed that, on average, nearly 94% of the variation of returns over time was explained by the investment policy decision.
1
 In layperson's terms, this means that most of a portfolio's return can be explained by the asset allocation decisions you make, not by timing or even security selection.

6. Waiting to Get Even
Getting even is just another way to ensure you lose any profit you might have accumulated. It means that you are waiting to sell a loser until it gets back to its original cost basis. Behavioral finance calls this a ""cognitive error."" By failing to realize a loss, investors are actually losing in two ways. First, they avoid selling a loser, which may continue to slide until it's worthless. Second, there's the opportunity cost of the better use of those investment dollars.

7. Failing to Diversify
While professional investors may be able to generate alpha (or excess return over a benchmark) by investing in a few concentrated positions, common investors should not try this. It is wiser to stick to the principle of diversification. In building an exchange traded fund (ETF) or mutual fund portfolio, it's important to allocate exposure to all major spaces. In building an individual stock portfolio, include all major sectors. As a general rule of thumb, do not allocate more than 5% to 10% to any one investment.

8. Letting Your Emotions Rule
Perhaps the number one killer of investment return is emotion. The axiom that fear and greed rule the market is true. Investors should not let fear or greed control their decisions. Instead, they should focus on the bigger picture. Stock market returns may deviate wildly over a shorter time frame, but, over the long term, historical returns tend to favor patient investors. In fact, over a 10 year time period the S&P 500 has delivered a 11.51% return as of May 13, 2022. Meanwhile the return year to date is -15.57%.
2

An investor ruled by emotion may see this type of negative return and panic sell, when in fact they probably would have been better off holding the investment for the long term. In fact, patient investors may benefit from the irrational decisions of other investors.

How to Avoid These Mistakes
Below are some other ways to avoid these common mistakes and keep a portfolio on track.

Develop a Plan of Action
Proactively determine where you are in the investment life cycle, what your goals are, and how much you need to invest to get there. If you don't feel qualified to do this, seek a reputable financial planner.

Also, remember why you are investing your money, and you will be inspired to save more and may find it easier to determine the right allocation for your portfolio. Temper your expectations to historical market returns. Do not expect your portfolio to make you rich overnight. A consistent, long-term investment strategy over time is what will build wealth.

Put Your Plan on Automatic
As your income grows, you may want to add more. Monitor your investments. At the end of every year, review your investments and their performance. Determine whether your equity-to-fixed-income ratio should stay the same or change based on where you are in life.

Allocate Some ""Fun"" Money
We all get tempted by the need to spend money at times. It's the nature of the human condition. So, instead of trying to fight it, go with it. Set aside ""fun investment money."" You should limit this amount to no more than 5% of your investment portfolio, and it should be money that you can afford to lose.

Do not use retirement money. Always seek investments from a reputable financial firm. Because this process is akin to gambling, follow the same rules you would in that endeavor.

Limit your losses to your principal (do not sell calls on stocks you don't own, for instance).
Be prepared to lose 100% of your investment.
Choose and stick to a pre-determined limit to determine when you will walk away.
The Bottom Line
Mistakes are part of the investing process. Knowing what they are, when you're committing them, and how to avoid them will help you succeed as an investor. To avoid committing the mistakes above, develop a thoughtful, systematic plan, and stick with it. If you must do something risky, set aside some fun money that you are fully prepared to lose. Follow these guidelines, and you will be well on your way to building a portfolio that will provide many happy returns over the long term."

When learning how to invest, it is important to learn from the best, but it also pays to learn from the worst.
These top 20 most common mistakes have been compiled to help investors know what to watch out for. If
any of these mistakes sound familiar, it is likely time to meet with a financial adviser.
TIPS FOR AVOIDING THE TOP 20
COMMON INVESTMENT MISTAKES
by Robert Stammers, CFA, Director, Investor Education
5. Buying high and selling low
The fundamental principle of investing is to buy low and sell high, so
why do so many investors do the opposite? Instead of rational decision making, many investment decisions are motivated by fear or
greed. In many cases, investors buy high in an attempt to maximize
short-term returns instead of trying to achieve long-term investment
goals. A focus on near-term returns leads to investing in the latest
investment craze or fad or investing in the assets or investment
strategies that were effective in the near past. Either way, once an
investment has become popular and gained the public’s attention, it
becomes more difficult to have an edge in determining its value.
6. Trading too much and too often
When investing, patience is a virtue. Often it takes time to gain the
ultimate benefits of an investment and asset allocation strategy.
Continued modification of investment tactics and portfolio composition can not only reduce returns through greater transaction
fees, it can also result in taking unanticipated and uncompensated
risks. You should always be sure you are on track. Use the impulse
to reconfigure your investment portfolio as a prompt to learn more
about the assets you hold instead of as a push to trade.
7. Paying too much in fees and commissions
Investing in a high-cost fund or paying too much in advisory fees is
a common mistake because even a small increase in fees can have
a significant effect on wealth over the long term. Before opening an
account, be aware of the potential cost of every investment decision. Look for funds that have fees that make sense and make sure
you are receiving value for the advisory fees you are paying.
8. Focusing too much on taxes
Although making investment decisions on the basis of potential
tax consequences is a bit like the tail wagging the dog, it is still a
common investor mistake. You should be smart about taxes—tax
loss harvesting can improve your returns significantly—but it is
important that the impetus to buy or sell a security is driven by its
merits, not its tax consequences.
1. Expecting too much or using someone else’s expectations
Investing for the long term involves creating a well-diversified portfolio designed to provide you with the appropriate levels of risk and
return under a variety of market scenarios. But even after designing
the right portfolio, no one can predict or control what returns the
market will actually provide. It is important not to expect too much
and to be careful when figuring out what to expect. Nobody can tell
you what a reasonable rate of return is without having an understanding of you, your goals, and your current asset allocation.
2. Not having clear investment goals
The adage, “If you don’t know where you are going, you will probably
end up somewhere else,” is as true of investing as anything else.
Everything from the investment plan to the strategies used, the
portfolio design, and even the individual securities can be configured
with your life objectives in mind. Too many investors focus on the
latest investment fad or on maximizing short-term investment return
instead of designing an investment portfolio that has a high probability of achieving their long-term investment objectives.
3. Failing to diversify enough
The only way to create a portfolio that has the potential to provide
appropriate levels of risk and return in various market scenarios is
adequate diversification. Often investors think they can maximize
returns by taking a large investment exposure in one security or
sector. But when the market moves against such a concentrated
position, it can be disastrous. Too much diversification and too many
exposures can also affect performance. The best course of action is
to find a balance. Seek the advice of a professional adviser.
4. Focusing on the wrong kind of performance
There are two timeframes that are important to keep in mind: the
short term and everything else. If you are a long-term investor,
speculating on performance in the short term can be a recipe for
disaster because it can make you second guess your strategy and
motivate short-term portfolio modifications. But looking past nearterm chatter to the factors that drive long-term performance is a
worthy undertaking. If you find yourself looking short term, refocus.
2
9. Not reviewing investments regularly
If you are invested in a diversified portfolio, there is an excellent
chance that some things will go up while others go down. At the end
of a quarter or a year, the portfolio you built with careful planning
will start to look quite different. Don’t get too far off track! Check in
regularly (at a minimum once a year) to make sure that your investments still make sense for your situation and (importantly) that your
portfolio doesn’t need rebalancing.
10. Taking too much, too little, or the wrong risk
Investing involves taking some level of risk in exchange for potential
reward. Taking too much risk can lead to large variations in investment performance that may be outside your comfort zone. Taking
too little risk can result in returns too low to achieve your financial
goals. Make sure that you know your financial and emotional ability
to take risks and recognize the investment risks you are taking.
11. Not knowing the true performance of your investments
It is shocking how many people have no idea how their investments
have performed. Even if they know the headline result or how a
couple of their stocks have done, they rarely know how they have
performed in the context of their portfolio. Even that is not enough;
you have to relate the performance of your overall portfolio to your
plan to see if you are on track after accounting for costs and inflation. Don’t neglect this! How else will you know how you are doing?
12. Reacting to the media
There are plenty of 24-hour news channels that make money by
showing “tradable” information. It would be foolish to try to keep
up. The key is to parse valuable information out of all the noise.
Successful and seasoned investors gather information from several
independent sources and conduct their own proprietary research
and analysis. Using the news as a sole source of investment analysis
is a common investor mistake because by the time the information
has become public, it has already been factored into market pricing.
13. Chasing yield
A high-yielding asset is a very seductive thing. Why wouldn’t you
try to maximize the amount of money you get back? Simple: Past
returns are no indication of future performance and the highest
yields carry the highest risks! Focus on the whole picture; don’t get
distracted while disregarding risk management.
14. Trying to be a market timing genius
Market timing is possible, but very, very, very hard. For people who
are not well trained, trying to make a well-timed call can be their
undoing. An investor that was out of the market during the top 10
trading days for the S&P 500 Index from 1993 to 2013 would have
achieved a 5.4% annualized return instead of 9.2% by staying
invested. This difference suggests that investors are better off contributing consistently to their investment portfolio rather than trying
to trade in and out in an attempt to time the market.
15. Not doing due diligence
There are many databases in which you can check whether the
people managing your money have the training, experience, and ethical standing to merit your trust. Why wouldn’t you check them? Ask
for references and check their work on the investments that they
recommend. The worst case is that you trade an afternoon of effort
for sleeping better at night. The best case is that you avoid the next
“Madoff” scheme. Any investor should be willing to take that trade.
16. Working with the wrong adviser
An investment adviser should be your partner in achieving your
investment goals. The ideal financial professional and financial
service provider not only has the ability to solve your problems but
shares a similar philosophy about investing and even life in general.
The benefits of taking extra time to find the right adviser far outweigh the comfort of making a quick decision.
17. Letting emotions get in the way
Investing brings up significant emotional issues that can impede
decision making. Do you want to involve your spouse in planning
your finances? What do you want to happen with your assets after
you die? Don’t let the immensity of these questions get in the way. A
good adviser will be able to help you construct a plan that works no
matter what the answers to these questions are.
18. Forgetting about inflation
Most investors focus on nominal returns instead of real returns. This
focus means looking at and comparing performance after fees and
inflation. Even if the economy is not in a massive inflationary period,
some costs will still rise! It is important to remember that what you
can buy with the assets you have is in many ways more important
than their value in dollar terms. Develop a discipline of focusing on
what is really important: your returns after adjusting for rising costs.
19. Neglecting to start or continue
Individuals often fail to begin an investment program simply because
they lack basic knowledge of where or how to start. Likewise,
periods of inactivity are frequently the result of lethargy or discouragement over previous investment losses. Investment management
is a discipline that is not overly complex, but requires continual effort
and analysis in order to be successful.
20. Not controlling what you can
People like to say that they can’t tell the future, but they neglect to
mention that you can take action to shape it. You can’t control what
the market will bear, but you can save more money! Continually
investing capital over time can have as much influence on wealth
accumulation as the return on investment. It is the surest way to
increase the probability of reaching your financial goals.

101,Not Misleading,"obody's perfect. We are all going to have our wins and losses, especially when it comes to investing. But some of the mistakes you might make when trading stocks are actually pretty common and by no means reserved exclusively for you alone. In fact, the majority of investors make many of the following mistakes. 

The good news is that most of these mistakes can be avoided simply through awareness. We will take a look at the 10 most common mistakes and identify ways in which you may be able to stop the habits—or even turn them to your advantage.

Key Takeaways
When investing, it's important to know some common pitfalls so you can be prepared to avoid them.
The biggest investing mistake you can make is not investing at all since you lose out on the power of compounding interest.
It's also important to keep your investments diversified and avoid investing in stocks you don't understand.
Other mistakes include expecting too much, risking more than you can afford, and failing to research before investing.
Not Investing
Of all of the mistakes that a beginner investor might make on their investing journey is not investing. Retirement is expensive, and unfortunately, most of us won’t be able to save enough without a lot of help from the stock market.

Imagine saving $250 per month from the age of 25 until you retire at age 65. If you were to keep that money in a bank account that does not accumulate interest, you would have just $120,000 by the time you retire. Unfortunately, that’s not likely to last you very long.

However, imagine if you had invested that money in the stock market and it was allowed to compound, meaning you earned interest on your interest. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the stock market has had an average annual return of about 10%.1

With that, your $250 per month contribution would result in more than $1.4 million by the time you retire. The same amount of money contributed throughout your life would be significantly higher by investing in the stock market instead of a non-interest-bearing account.

Buying Shares in Businesses You Don't Understand
Another mistake is when investors gravitate towards the latest ""hot"" industry but know little or nothing about the company or industry. Without proper research, you stand to lose your hard-earned money, particularly if you don't know the company's financial viability. However, when you research and understand a business and its industry, you have a naturally built-in advantage over most other investors.

Note
When you invest outside your knowledge base, you may not know the subtleties and complexity of the company in question. This is not to say that you need to be a gold miner to invest in gold mining companies or a medical doctor to invest in health care, but proper due diligence is critical, or consider hiring a financial advisor to help.

Putting All of Your Eggs in One Basket
When you put all of your eggs into one investment, one negative event could damage your entire portfolio and, therefore, your financial future. Diversifying your portfolio helps reduce your risk so that if one of your investments underperforms, it doesn’t necessarily impact your entire portfolio.

You can diversify across asset classes, such as investing a portion in stocks, bonds, and real estate. If the stock market crashes, for example, the bond market might perform well, helping reduce your losses from equities. Another way to diversify is to invest in multiple companies within one industry. You can also buy several sector funds in which each fund focuses on one industry, such as technology or financials.

Note
Investing in index funds, mutual funds, or exchange traded funds (ETFs) is an easy way to diversify your portfolio through just one investment.

Expecting Too Much From the Stock
Another investing mistake is expecting too much return from a stock, which can be especially true when buying penny stocks. Low-priced stocks might appear to be lottery tickets, allowing a $500 or $2,000 investment to become a small fortune. However, there is a significant risk of loss with penny stocks, and investors that expect a small, underperforming company to outperform its peers might be disappointed. It's essential to have a realistic view of what to expect from the performance of the company's shares.

Note
Review the past performance of the stock you are interested in and decide based on the company's financial performance as well as the stock's historical trends and gains. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, it can be a good starting point since it provides insight into the stock's volatility and trading activity.

Using Money You Can't Afford To Risk
When you invest money that you cannot afford to risk, your emotions and stress levels get heightened, which can lead to poor and impulsive investment decisions. When evaluating stocks, consider your risk tolerance, which is your willingness to lose a portion or all of your original investment in exchange for higher returns. When determining your risk tolerance, evaluate the securities or asset classes you're comfortable with, such as growth stocks versus bonds.

Don't invest money you can't afford to lose, such as your rent money or emergency savings. Conversely, you will make much better investment decisions by investing money that you can afford to risk.

Being Driven by Impatience
Another investing mistake is a lack of patience. If you're investing for the long term, stocks may not experience the desired gains right away.

If a company's management team unveils a new strategy, it may take months or several years for that new approach to play out. Too often, investors will buy shares of the stock and then immediately expect the shares to act in their best interest.

For example, the broader S&P 500 index has given an average annual return of 9.01% between 2000 and 2021. This includes numerous years when the index saw negative returns, including the Great Recession in 2008, when it was down by 36.5%.2

Note
What often makes investing profitable is the magic of compounding. Compounding takes time to really work, which is why those who start saving for retirement when they’re young often see the best returns.

Learning About Stocks From the Wrong Places
Getting stock tips or information from the wrong sources is another common and costly investing mistake. There is no shortage of so-called experts who are willing to offer their opinions while presenting them as if they are educated and endlessly correct.

Even stock analysts that work for investment firms get it wrong and usually have a solid grasp of the company and the industry they cover. In other words, even if they're qualified to render an opinion, they can still be wrong.

Generally, government-backed sources and nonprofit organizations are a good place to start for general investment advice or guidance. You could also consult a financial advisor to guide you through the process.

Note
Not even the most experienced and successful investor can predict the future. If an investment professional guarantees a certain outcome on your investment, consider it a red flag.

Following the Crowd
Following the crowd is another investing mistake since it doesn't involve research but instead mirrors what other investors are doing. Many people only hear about an investment after it has already performed well. If certain stocks double or triple in price, the mainstream media tends to cover those moves as hot takes.

Unfortunately, by the time the media gets involved, the stock may have reached its peak. At that point, the investment is likely overvalued. Nevertheless, television, newspaper, and the internet (including social media) can push stocks higher into excessively overvalued territory.

Note
One example of this trend was the 2021 hype around the GameStop stock. By the time the surge reached the mainstream media, most of the gains had already been made. Those investors who got in too late likely ended up losing money.

Averaging Down and the Sunk Cost Fallacy
Averaging down can be a costly mistake when investing. Averaging down is typically used by investors who have made a mistake already and need to cover their error. For example, if they bought the stock at $3.50, and it drops to $1.75, they might make that mistake look less awful by purchasing more shares at the lower price.

The result is that now they've bought the stock at $3.50, and more at $1.75, so their average price per share is much lower, making their loss appear far smaller than reality. However, by buying more shares that have dropped in value, you're sinking more money into a losing trade, which is why averaging down can also be considered throwing good money after bad. Averaging down is a symptom of what is sometimes referred to as the sunk cost fallacy. This occurs when an individual is reluctant to change a particular behavior or belief due to the feeling that they have already spent so much time, money, or energy on the given behavior or belief.

Conversely, an effective strategy is to average up, which is when you purchase more shares once the stock price has risen, confirming that you made a good call.

Not Doing Your Due Diligence
Not performing due diligence when investing can be a costly mistake. Venture capitalists and investment funds perform due diligence regularly to ensure their investments are worthwhile. With a proper due diligence strategy that is predetermined, organizations are more likely not to be blindsided and make well-evaluated investment decisions, according to the Global Impact Investing Network.3 

An individual investor should perform proper due diligence, especially with highly speculative and volatile penny stock shares. Typically, the more due diligence, the better your investing results. If you've reviewed the company, including any warning signs and potential risks, you're much less likely to be negatively surprised by an event. 

The Bottom Line
Ideally, you won't commit too many of these common errors. However, investors will make some of the mistakes that we've discussed. Luckily, you can channel your inner teenager and learn from your mistakes. In fact, most people learn more from their losses than they do from their gains.

Given enough time and experience, you will likely be in a better and more profitable situation. Ideally, you want to phase out the common mistakes quickly enough so that you still have funds remaining to invest."

105,Not Misleading,"What Are Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)?
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are a type of Treasury security issued by the U.S. government. TIPS are indexed to inflation to protect investors from a decline in the purchasing power of their money.

As inflation rises, rather than their yield increasing, TIPS instead adjust in price (principal amount) to maintain their real value. The interest rate on a TIPS investment is fixed at the time of issuance, but the interest payments keep up with inflation because they vary with the adjusted principal amount.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are a type of Treasury bond that is indexed to an inflationary gauge to protect investors from a decline in the purchasing power of their money.
The principal value of TIPS rises as inflation rises, while the interest payment varies with the adjusted principal value of the bond.
The principal amount is protected since investors will never receive less than the originally invested principal.
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
Understanding Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
The principal value of TIPS rises as inflation rises. Inflation is the pace at which prices increase throughout the U.S. economy, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Inflation becomes an issue when there isn’t a commensurate rise in real wage growth to offset the negative effects of rising prices.1

TIPS are a popular asset for protecting portfolios from inflation and profiting from it because they pay interest every six months based on a fixed rate determined at the bond’s auction. However, the interest payment amounts can vary since the rate is applied to the adjusted principal or value of the bond. If the principal amount is adjusted higher over time due to rising prices, then the interest rate will be multiplied by the increased principal amount. As a result, investors receive higher interest or coupon payments as inflation rises. Conversely, investors will receive lower interest payments if deflation occurs.1

TIPS are issued with maturities of five, 10, and 30 years and are considered a low-risk investment because the U.S. government backs them. At maturity, TIPS return the adjusted principal or the original principal, whichever is greater.1 

TIPS can be purchased directly from the government through the TreasuryDirect system, in $100 increments with a minimum investment of $100, and are available with the aforementioned maturities.1

Some investors prefer to get TIPS through a TIPS mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF). However, purchasing TIPS directly allows investors to avoid the management fees associated with mutual funds.

TIPS’ Price Relationship to Inflation
TIPS are important since they help combat the inflation risk that erodes the yield on fixed-rate bonds. Inflation risk is an issue because the interest rate paid on most bonds is fixed for the life of the bond. As a result, the bond’s interest payments might not keep up with inflation. For example, if prices rise by 3% and an investor’s bond pays 2%, then the investor has a net loss in real terms.

TIPS are designed to protect investors from the adverse effects of rising prices over the life of the bond. The par value—principal—increases with inflation and decreases with deflation, as measured by the CPI. As mentioned earlier, when TIPS mature, bondholders are paid the inflation-adjusted principal or original principal, whichever is greater.1 

Suppose an investor owns $1,000 in TIPS at the end of the year, with a coupon rate of 1%. If there is no inflation as measured by the CPI, then the investor will receive $10 in coupon payments for that year. If inflation rises by 2%, however, then the $1,000 principal will be adjusted upward by 2% to $1,020. The coupon rate will remain the same at 1%, but it will be multiplied by the adjusted principal amount of $1,020 to arrive at an interest payment of $10.20 for the year.

Conversely, if inflation were negative—known as deflation—with prices falling 5%, then the principal would be adjusted downward to $950. The resulting interest payment would be $9.50 over the year. However, at maturity, the investor would receive no less than the principal amount invested of $1,000 or an adjusted higher principal, if applicable.1

The interest payments during the life of the bond are subject to being calculated based on a lower principal amount in the event of deflation, but the investor is never at risk of losing the original principal if held to maturity. If investors sell TIPS before maturity in the secondary market, they might receive less than the initial principal.1

 TIPS don’t work as a short-term hedge against spikes in inflation. Their real function is to protect investors against rising living costs over the long term.
How to Buy TIPS
As with other Treasury securities, investors can buy TIPS directly from the U.S. government at the Treasury website TreasuryDirect.gov. This entails a somewhat complicated login process with several security layers.1

You can also buy TIPS directly from your bank or broker. This may be more convenient for those investors who already have a substantial portfolio of securities at a certain financial institution.
Advantages and Disadvantages of TIPS
While TIPS are an attractive prospect for investors who expect high levels of inflation, they are at a disadvantage to other types of debt during periods of ordinary inflation. Below are some other considerations to keep in mind:

Lower yield: TIPS usually pay lower interest rates than other government or corporate securities, so they are not necessarily optimal for income investors. Their advantage is mainly inflation protection, but if inflation is minimal or nonexistent, then their utility decreases.
Tax considerations: Like other Treasury bonds, the interest and inflation adjustments on TIPS are exempt from state and local income taxes. However, the inflation adjustment is considered taxable income by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), even though investors don’t see that money until they sell the bond or it reaches maturity.2 Some investors hold TIPS in tax-deferred retirement accounts to avoid tax complications. However, it may be worth contacting a tax professional to discuss any potential tax ramifications of investing in TIPS.
Pros
The principal increases with inflation, meaning that at maturity, bondholders are paid the inflation-adjusted principal

Investors will never be paid less than their original principal when TIPS mature

Interest payments increase as inflation increases, since the rate is calculated based on the adjusted principal balance

Cons
The interest rate offered is usually lower than most fixed-income bonds that do not have an inflation adjustment

Investors might be subject to higher taxes on increased coupon payments

If inflation does not materialize while TIPS are held, then the utility of holding TIPS decreases

Example of TIPS
Below is a comparison of the 10-year TIPS to the 10-year Treasury note, both issued and auctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department. Treasury notes (T-notes) are intermediate-term bonds maturing in two, three, five, seven, or 10 years. They provide semiannual interest payments at fixed coupon rates.3

As a historical example, on March 29, 2019, the 10-year TIPS was auctioned with an interest rate of 0.875%.4 On the other hand, the 10-year Treasury note was auctioned on March 15, 2019, with an interest rate of 2.625% per year.5

We can see that the 10-year note pays more interest (meaning that investors will receive higher coupon payments from the 10-year note compared to the TIPS investment). However, if inflation rises, then the principal on the TIPS will increase, allowing for the coupon payments to rise, while the 10-year note is fixed for the life of the bond. Although TIPS protect against inflation, the offset is typically a lower yield than bonds with similar maturities.

How Did TIPS Perform in 2022?
In 2022, inflation in the United States hit highs not seen in four decades, leading many investors to flock to TIPS for protection. However, that insurance policy didn’t really go according to plan. These inflation-protecting securities fell an average of 14.2% during the course of the year, performing not much better than regular Treasuries and major equity markets.6
This serves as a reminder of how TIPS work and how they are often misunderstood. When inflation soared in 2022, the Federal Reserve—as it normally does when the cost of living rockets—hiked interest rates. And steep increases in the cost of borrowing caused TIPS, like the rest of the bond market, to plummet in value, despite the extra payouts tied to inflation.

What 2022 taught many investors is that TIPS carry the same underlying interest rate risk exposure as other bonds and, therefore, are not the pure-play inflation hedge that some people may have thought they were. Many were fooled into thinking that TIPS returns are perfectly correlated to changes in inflation. Hopefully, they have learned their lesson.
TIPS are designed to protect investors against inflation over the long term rather than act as a short-term hedge against soaring prices.

How Can I Buy Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)?
You can buy TIPS directly from the U.S. Treasury’s TreasuryDirect website, with a minimum purchase of $100.1 You can also typically buy them through your broker. There are also several mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in TIPS and other inflation-linked securities that you can buy and sell like ordinary shares of stock.

Can I Buy TIPS for My Individual Retirement Account (IRA)?
Yes. You can include TIPS and funds that hold TIPS in an individual retirement account (IRA); however, you cannot use the TreasuryDirect service to buy them directly in an IRA. Instead, you would need to rely on the broker holding your retirement account.

What Yields Do TIPS Have?
The yields on TIPS are often negative. This is because after taking into account the effects of inflation, the real yield is negative. For instance, if standard two-year Treasuries yield 1% but inflation is 2%, then the real yield is -1%.

TIPS are meant to keep up with inflation, not beat inflation. Therefore, you can have a nominal yield on TIPS that is positive but a real yield that is effectively zero. Note that while the yield on TIPS may be negative, their principal value will increase with inflation, which can generate capital gains.

Why Does the Treasury Issue TIPS?
TIPS first appeared in 1997. The official reason for their appearance is that there was strong demand from the investing public for inflation-linked government securities.7 However, some economists have been puzzled by the government’s continued issuance of TIPS since they amount to a more expensive way to borrow than traditional Treasuries.8

What Maturities Do TIPS Come in?
The original TIPS were set at 20-year maturities. In 2009, 20-year TIPS were discontinued in favor of 30-year TIPS. The U.S. Treasury currently issues five-, 10-, and 30-year TIPS.7

The Bottom Line
TIPS are among the many types of debt securities offered by the U.S. Treasury Department. You can think of them as Treasuries with a twist—their principal value is tied to inflation to protect investors when the cost of living rises. However, they are often misunderstood.

It’s important to know that inflation protection comes at a cost, as most of these securities carry lower interest rates than other similar government bonds. Also, bear in mind that at the time of maturity, bondholders are paid the inflation-adjusted principal or original principal, whichever is greater. In other words, there’s protection in place for instances when there’s lots of deflation.

Another common misconception is that TIPS are guaranteed to do well when inflation is rising and function as a great short-term hedge when the cost of living suddenly spikes. As 2022 taught us, TIPS are bonds at the end of the day, and bond markets react badly to rising interest rates."

I'd be aiming for the 20-25% of gross income goal now. Do not pay your mortgage off in your 30s. Use compounded money from investing in your 30s heavily to pay your mortgage in your 40s. Your payments will not go up like other posters have said, you own almost half of the house at this point.

What Does Morningstar Think of the Reddit Advice on Investing?
""Hey OP's - wow in your early 30's and putting away close to half your after-tax income every month? Congratulations on a spectacular savings rate and a substantial dent on your mortgage,” says Morningstar Canada’s director of investment research Ian Tam.

He warns though, that one thing to keep an eye on right now is when the OPs’ mortgage term renews. “As you know the Bank of Canada has increased interest rates substantially post-pandemic, and if you bought your house in 2017, you've likely renewed your mortgage term in 2022 or before, when interest rates were still quite low. When you renew again, there is a chance your monthly mortgage payments will be much higher than you're accustomed to depending on where rates are. If you are averse to paying higher interest on your mortgage, you may want to ensure that you have some money ready to pay down that principal in a lump sum when it renews (or before if your mortgage allows for lump sum pre-payments),” he says.

The reason this is important, Tam explains, is that it will define whether you invest in something for the long term (15+ years) or something short term (less than 5 years). Your investment time horizon helps define the amount of risk you can take on, with longer horizons allowing for riskier investments.  

“Given your age and savings rate, this is a great time to start investing. If you didn't feel like you were getting good value from talking to an advisor at the bank, you might opt to try one of the Robo-advice channels that have gained prominence in Canada. Remember that many banks have their own robo-advice divisions, so the advisor is not the only option. Because of your relatively straightforward financial situation, a robo-advisor might be a good way to save on advice fees, while still receiving the much-needed assessment of your risk profile and in turn matching you with an appropriate set of investments. Moreover, most robo-advice channels in Canada will set you up with a well-diversified portfolio of low-cost passive ETFs, which is a great way to save further on fees which can compound significantly over time,” Tam says.  

Finally, he urges the OPs to look into registered tax shelters (TFSA and RRSP), which are both ways to keep more of their savings in their own pocket by reducing or deferring taxes.

Morningstar’s 7 Tips on Starting Your Investing Journey
The OP and his wife are what are known as early career accumulators—loosely defined as people in their 20s and 30s. This demographic has earnings often low relative to where they’ll be in the future, and they may also have debt (in the OP’s case, a mortgage.) But early career accumulators have other assets that their older counterparts can look upon with envy. With a whole lifetime of earnings stretching before them, early career people are long on what investment researchers call human capital: Their ability to earn a living is their greatest asset by a mile.

“Investors in their 20s and 30s have a valuable asset when it comes to investing, too: With a very long time horizon until they’ll need to begin withdrawing their money (for retirement, at least), early career investors can better harness the power of compound interest. They can also tolerate higher-volatility investments that, over long periods of time, are apt to generate higher returns than safer investments,” says Morningstar director of personal finance Christine Benz.

She adds that for most investors, it’s hard to go too far wrong with the mantra of investing as much as you can on a regular basis and sticking with very basic, well-diversified investments. “But it also pays to think of your “investments” in a broad sense, steering your hard-earned dollars to those opportunities that promise the highest return on your investment over your time horizon. For most people, that will require a bit of multitasking,” she says.

She offers seven tips for investing well and multitasking in your 20s and 30s:

Put debt in its place.
Make the investment in human capital.
Build a safety net.
Kick-start your retirement accounts.
Focus on tax-sheltered vehicles.
Invest in line with your risk capacity.
Employ simple, well-diversified building blocks."

110,Not Misleading,"An investment strategy is a defined approach to investing that shapes the choices an investor makes for his or her portfolio. Different investment strategies assume specific tactics based on fundamental beliefs. For instance, value investing seeks stocks that are undervalued and are selling for less than their true worth, whereas growth investing aims to find investment opportunities in companies that have a high potential for growth. This guide will break down the major investment strategies and help you decide which of them is likely to be a good choice for you. You can also work with a financial advisor to help create the right asset allocation for your portfolio. 

How to Choose an Investment Strategy
There are a number of factors that go into choosing the investment strategy that will work best for you. One thing is to think about whether you want to choose an active or passive investing strategy. Active investing involves the frequent buying and selling of stocks.  It requires hands-on management, often by a portfolio manager who can delve into various factors to forecast the market.

Passive strategies, on the other hand, are focused on buying and holding investments for the long haul. Proponents of passive strategies argue this cuts down on trading costs and increases tax efficiency. It also tends to be less risky than market-timing strategies, which can reap big rewards by trying to beat the market but also suffer big losses. Oftentimes, portfolios will blend active and passive investing.

Other factors you need to consider are your time horizon, such as how close you are to major life events like buying a house, having children or retiring. If you need income soon, you may not want to select long-term investments,  for instance. Your risk tolerance is another consideration. Generally, you can tolerate more risk early in your career, and desire less risky, more stable investments as you move toward retirement. A strategy like income investing, which is based on generating a steady income, might be less risky than a more subjective strategy like value investing.

1. Growth Investing
Growth investing is an investment strategy that focuses on building capital through buying equities that have the potential to increase in value. This is most commonly found in stocks where investors believe the value of the company, and thus the value of the shares they’ve purchased, is likely to go up.

Growth investing contains several sub-strategies. Two of the most common are short-term investments and long-term investments. Short-term generally means buying stocks and holding them for less than a year. Investors use short-term growth investments when they think a company’s value is likely to shoot up quickly. Long-term investments, on the other hand, are held for more than a year. Investors use these when they believe the company’s value will grow slowly and steadily over the years.

Growth investing can touch on numerous sectors, such as:

Emerging markets
Tech
Energy
Aerospace
2. Value Investing
Value investing, an investment strategy championed by Warren Buffett, focuses on seeking out stocks that you believe are intrinsically undervalued. By finding companies the market does not properly value, investors have the potential to post big gains when the market eventually corrects and the company becomes valued properly. This is a very subjective type of investing.

3. Income Investing
investment strategies
Income investing focuses on generating a steady income from your investments. Rather than seeking stocks that will grow in value and give your portfolio more hypothetical value but make you no richer in terms of cash, income investing wants to find investments where your portfolio sees real-world value in the form of money in your pocket.

Income investments generally take two forms. The first is stocks that pay dividends. Some companies pay their investors a percentage of profits in the form of a dividend. That is cash that goes into your account if you own stock. The other investment common to income investing is bonds, which pay out on a consistent basis.

4. Socially Responsible Investing
investment strategies
The previous investment strategies focus more so on how an investor makes money. This investing strategy is a bit different in that it takes a broader look at how your investment can impact the world at large, beyond your portfolio.

You can tailor a socially responsible investing strategy to what you personally care about when it comes to social responsibility. If you are an environmentalist, for instance, you might invest heavily in green companies and avoid investing in companies that deal in fossil fuels. If you care about foreign policy, you might avoid companies that do business in certain countries.

Halal investing — investing done following Islamic principles — is another form of socially conscious investing. This means, among other things, not investing in companies that deal in alcohol, gambling or pork products.

5. Small Cap Investing
Small cap investing focuses on companies with a market cap — that is total value — between $250 million and $2 billion. This means you don’t invest in the companies that many investors focus on (think Apple, Ford, IBM, etc.) and instead in smaller companies you think could do well in the future.

Small cap companies often have few shares available for public purchase. Because institutional investors generally don’t want to own too big of a percentage of a company, they might shy away from the companies, giving individual investors a leg up.

6. Buy-and-Hold Investing
A buy-and-hold investment strategy involves finding investments that are likely to perform well over several years. Even when the market dips this strategy employs the mentality of staying the course and believing that the investments will have a positive return over the long haul. If this is the strategy for you then you’ll be less worried about the short-term impact on the market as the belief is that the market performs well over a period of several years.

7. Active Investing
Active investing is much different than buy-and-hold as it focuses on riding the ebbs and flows of the market, making much. more frequent trades. It can be very difficult to analyze the market effectively and active investors use a number of strategies to do just that. They focus on anything from trading based on events to setting up daily technical analysis to find potential quick returns.

The Bottom Line
There is no easy way to pick which investing strategy you should choose when building your own portfolio. You might end up with a mix of sorts as you find that the right strategy for you involves multiple types of investment strategies. The best way to pick an investing strategy is to think about your financial and personal goals. Then figure out which strategy is most likely to help you achieve those goals. You can also enlist the help of a financial advisor.

Investing strategies aid investors in deciding where and how to invest based on factors like projected return, risk tolerance, corpus size, long-term versus short-term holdings, retirement age, industry preference, etc. 
Investors can tailor their investing plans to the aims and objectives they hope to accomplish.
Therefore, to reduce transaction costs, the passive method entails purchasing and keeping stocks rather than trading them regularly. 
Passive techniques tend to be less risky because they are believed to be incapable of outperforming the market due to their volatility.
Top 7 Types of Investment Strategies
Let’s discuss different types of investment strategies, one by one.

#1 – Passive and Active Strategies
The passive strategy involves buying and holding
 stocks and not frequently dealing in them to avoid higher transaction costs. They believe they cannot outperform the market due to its volatility; hence passive strategies tend to be less risky. On the other hand, active strategies involve frequent buying and selling. They believe they can outperform the market and can gain more returns than an average investor would.

#2 – Growth Investing (Short-Term and Long-Term Investments)
Investors chose the holding period based on the value they want to create in their portfolio. If investors believe that a company will grow in the coming years and the intrinsic value of a stock will go up, they will invest in such companies to build their corpus value. This is also known as growth investing
. On the other hand, if investors believe that a company will deliver good value in a year or two, they will go for short term holding. The holding period also depends upon the preference of investors. For example, how soon they want money to buy a house, school education for kids, retirement plans, etc.

#3 – Value Investing
Value investing strategy involves investing in the company by looking at its intrinsic value because such companies are undervalued by the stock market. The idea behind investing in such companies is that when the market goes for correction
, it will correct the value for such undervalued companies, and the price will then shoot up, leaving investors with high returns when they sell. This strategy is used by the very famous Warren Buffet.

#4 – Income Investing
This type of strategy focuses on generating cash income from stocks rather than investing in stocks that only increase the value of your portfolio. There are two types of cash income which an investor can earn – (1) Dividend

Diligence is Key
Conducting due diligence is an indispensable aspect of real estate investing that demands an unwavering attention to detail and a shrewd assessment of various elements. This process begins with a thorough investigation of the local market and economic conditions, encompassing a comprehensive analysis of prevailing market trends, supply and demand dynamics, and property values. By grasping the nuances of the local market, you can adeptly discern potential opportunities and risks, enabling you to make well-informed decisions when selecting properties for investment.

Agents adeptly navigate the intricacies of the real estate landscape, pinpointing properties that align with your investment criteria.

Embrace this journey of meticulous planning and rigorous research, and you will be poised to construct a flourishing real estate portfolio that not only promises long-term financial stability but also bestows the cherished freedom to savor life on your own terms.

Forge an Adept Team
Building a formidable team is a pivotal pillar of success in the realm of real estate investing, and it entails fostering a network of industry contacts teeming with invaluable insights and resources. Initiatives like attending local investment clubs and networking events play a crucial role in cultivating relationships with like-minded investors, seasoned professionals, and service providers.

Assembling a robust team requires a discerning eye for professionals with a wealth of experience in real estate investing and the capacity to provide astute guidance. A specialized real estate agent attuned to investment properties can become your trusted ally, adeptly identifying prospective opportunities and skillfully negotiating terms that align with your aspirations. Meanwhile, a lender well-versed in real estate investing can furnish you with financing options tailored to your investment objectives and risk tolerance, streamlining the path to realizing your dreams.

Keep your Eyes on the Cash-flow
To optimize cash flow and unlock the true potential of your real estate investments, one effective strategy is to identify properties that are undervalued or in need of repairs. By acquiring such properties at a discounted price and implementing strategic improvements, you not only enhance their value but also augment their rental potential. The result? A steady surge in cash flow and the promise of long-term appreciation that bestows prosperity upon your investment.

When you invest in undervalued properties, you effectively capitalize on hidden gems that the market may have overlooked, seizing an opportunity to unlock their latent value. By applying your vision and expertise to undertake renovations and upgrades, you breathe new life into these properties, rendering them attractive to potential tenants or buyers. As the property undergoes a transformation, its rental potential surges, paving the way for a reliable and substantial influx of rental income. Over time, as the property’s value appreciates, your initial investment flourishes, and the rewards of your strategic approach amplify, delivering long-term prosperity and financial security.

Another avenue to bolster cash flow is to embrace alternative rental strategies that outperform traditional long-term rentals. Embrace the allure of short-term rentals or vacation rentals that, while requiring a different management approach, hold the potential for significantly higher rental income. Capitalizing on travelers seeking short stays or vacationers in search of immersive experiences, these rental options can generate more substantial returns on your investment.

In tandem with a focus on cash flow, a crucial tenet of real estate success is to adopt a long-term perspective. While markets may endure short-term fluctuations, history demonstrates that real estate values tend to appreciate over extended periods. As a prudent investor, aligning your strategy with long-term growth and stability becomes paramount. By selecting properties with the potential to appreciate over time, you not only secure your initial investment but also bolster your overall return on investment as the years unfold. Such an approach constructs a sturdy foundation for long-term wealth building, fortifying your financial standing and empowering you with the freedom to chart your desired path.

Patience and Discipline are Essential Virtues
Patience and discipline are the cornerstones of triumph in the ever-fluctuating realm of real estate investing. The market’s capricious nature may spark fervor during a scorching hot phase or cast shadows of discouragement during a downturn. Yet, seasoned real estate investors comprehend that these undulations are intrinsic to the game, and the true path to success lies in unwavering dedication to long-term goals. To achieve enduring prosperity, they shun the allure of quick gains and resist succumbing to panic during market downturns. Instead, they adopt a disciplined approach, steadfastly adhering to a meticulously crafted investment strategy.

In this mercurial landscape, the essence of patience lies in the ability to remain resolute and composed, impervious to the allure of short-term gratification. As the market surges, successful investors resist the temptation to chase fleeting opportunities, opting instead to focus on their overarching vision. Likewise, when faced with market troughs, they eschew knee-jerk reactions and stand firm, trusting in the fundamentals of their investment plan. By navigating these market cycles with a composed and patient demeanor, these seasoned investors weather the storms and emerge on the other side with their financial fortitude intact.

Furthermore, embracing a continuous journey of learning and improvement is a cornerstone of real estate success. The landscape of this industry is ever-evolving, and to thrive, investors must remain abreast of the latest trends, regulations, and best practices. Staying at the forefront of knowledge empowers them to make informed investment decisions, capitalizing on emerging opportunities and avoiding potential pitfalls.

Successful investors are never complacent; they relentlessly seek to augment their expertise and skills. Engaging in networking events, rubbing shoulders with industry luminaries, and attending relevant gatherings form part of their continuous growth strategy. Moreover, they proactively pursue additional education and certifications to elevate their investment acumen. This unwavering commitment to self-improvement places them ahead of the curve, equipping them with the discernment to make astute investment decisions and capitalize on propitious moments.

Conclusion
Real estate investing is a formidable instrument for generating wealth and attaining financial autonomy, but its success relies on meticulous planning, thorough research, and skillful execution. By heeding the counsel of these five fundamental tips – envisioning clear objectives and crafting a robust strategy, diligently conducting due diligence, forging a reliable and resourceful team, prioritizing cash flow optimization, and embodying patience and discipline – you elevate the odds of prosperity and foster a portfolio rife with profitable property investments.

It is imperative to bear in mind that real estate investing is a long-term endeavor, replete with its share of trials and tribulations.

117,Not Misleading,"When 10 year old kids picked shares against them were Chartered Account,  they also picked shares. There the 10-year-old kids picked better stocks and made more money. How did the 10-year-old kids do that,  we will find out in this video. It's said, ""If the base is good, then the building will be well made"". So I have came here today with this video and I will make your stock market base strong so that you will make so much money,  and build your own buildings. Hello friends, I'm Pranjal Kamra and on today's Finology we will clear all stock market basics. Beginners get scared by just hearing share markets' names. In films, we see the share market destroys everything but friends are claiming that they are making lots of money. Besides that family members says to stay away from it. Above that, if you had studied commerce in school or college still there it's not exactly told correctly about the share market. In that case, it's normal to have confusion and nervousness. But today, after this video, all of your confusion will be cleared and you will find out how and where to enter. First know a Fun Fact to pique your interest. If you had 40 years ago, in WIPRO... I know you might not have been born then, someone in your family had invested Rs-10,000 in WIPRO shares. So today, 40 years later, it would be Rs-700 crore. I know, you might be thinking who had Rs-10,000 than. If invested Rs-1000, that would be Rs-70 crore at least Rs-100 was there, that would also become Rs-7 crore. So this is the potential of stock market. From this example, you must not think that I want you to somehow enter this market. Definitely, there are risks in the market. As there is profit, there is loss also. There are many such stocks where if you had invested Rs-700 crore, it would be Rs-10,000 now. So this market can bring you big profits and big losses too. But so you make little loss and gain more profit I’m here for that you know right. Son now I’m going to tell you those common questions beginners can have maybe you all have them and I’m going to cover those questions. So first I'm going to tell you all the questions and also in this video, I will give you the timestamps so the questions you like you can directly go to that particular minute or second to find the answer of that question. The first we are going to discuss is the share market risky, if yes then how much? Second, we'll know, how much return can you make how much expectation can you make on this market? Third, we'll know how much money  you'll need to start in this market? You can be a beginner or a student so can you start with your pocket money? Fourth process, is entering easy or difficult? what is Demat and Trading Account? basically how to start. Fifth we'll know, why this market has a bad name why do our family members, films make us fear about it what are those reasons, is this market really dangerous? Should you stay away from it. Sixth we'll know, and this is a common question you are not of commerce background,  you can be of engineering or arts background. Still can you enter this market? Seventh, how dose this market works? Why does that share price go up and down? On which basis can you select a share. And eighthly we'll know if you need in-depth knowledge then which are those books and courses, how to make a carrier out of it? Which vlogs and magazines should you read? Basically, how can you complete your learning,  we will discuss this at the end of this video. So the first question is, is the share market risky? This I ask you through a basic example. Basically when you buy a share you buy a somewhat small part in that company. That's why it's called share, and you are becoming a co-owner of it. So now you tell me if you invest in a friend's business or a relatives and if that business doesn’t do well then your money will drown, that's a risk. Just like that in the share market, you are investing in big companies like TATA, Reliance, Godrej. And if the company drowns, then your money will also drown. If the company shows very good growth,  then your money will also grow. It's just like you invest in your family member or friend's business in this hope, if the business grows, I will get a part of the profit and if it losses then I will take the loss, and won't have to give any interest. In the share market, you don't get any interest, because it's not a loan. So there are many companies that drown and make a loss. But look at Eicher Motors in the past 7-8 years,  they have increased the sale of Bullet bikes many times. Like that many times, more shares have grown which means Rs-1 have grown 10x-20x times. There are many shares like this, I’ve given the example of WIPRO, TVS is a example which has grown 10x times in 10 years, MRF is also an example, there are many more shares like this which gives you 10x times return in 5-6 years. Definitely, it's risky and that's why the returns are high and we will discuss Risk Mitigation methods in this video, to lower the risk. Now comes the second question, that's how much return will I get? And again the example is the same if you invest in a friends business so who knows if you invest Rs-10, in the next year you'll get 10% profit or 20% profit or 30% profit it differs a lot and cannot be a fixed criteria. For this, there are many shares in the market which doesn’t grows a single rupee, instead falls and some grows 4x to 5x times in a single year. But it's just about one share when you'll enter it will not just be one or two shares you'll invest in a portfolio of stocks, like at least 8-10 companies. Because if 1-2 companies comes out bad or drowns still, you don't overall lose all of your money. That's why in the share market we invest in at least 8-10 companies so when you get a basket of stocks, you can believe that if you have invested correctly so 18% to 20% return in India's high growth economy in the long run, which is at least 5 years if you had invested and you picked good stocks then you'll definitely get around 18% to 20% in return. This means compare to FDs, which are trending now is 3x times more, and 2x times more compare to Gold and Real estate. In fact, there are many successful investors in the world who in low growth economies than India where market and companies are slowly growing there they picked such stocks,  where they get around 30% return for many years. So in India if you are expecting 20% return then it's now wrong. But your stock picking should be good. How to find such shares that will grow  and bring growth to your money. To find this out you must watch this video The link is in the above card and in the description. Before that, it's important to fully watch this video so you clear your basic concepts. Now, very interesting question How much money is enough to start? See despite the amount of money you are investing in the stock market it's more important in which type of shares are you investing and how consistently they give return. I give you an example if you start with Rs-1000 per month which many of us can afford starting with, that we have to invest Rs-1000 monthly in share market. And every year increase this Rs-1000 by 15% which means first year you'll invest Rs-1000 every month Rs-12,000 a year. From the next year increase that by 15% which mean you'll invest Rs-1150 a month. And like that every year, as your income grows you go from student life to an earning member or if you get a promotion and your salary gets increased. So if you do that, starting with Rs-1000 and every year 15% increment and you are getting only 15% return on your investment not 18% or 20%. Despite that, starting with Rs-1000, after 25 years you will have Rs-1 crore. The key is, you have to invest for 25 years second, you have to increase the amount by 15% third you have to get 15% return. If this three things happens, after 25 years starting from Rs-1000, you will have Rs-1 crore. So how did I calculate this? With SPI Calculator, and its link is in the description using it you can figure out if you started with Rs-2000 or Rs-3000 so after what year how much will you make  you can find out yourself. The calculator is in the video's description. Fourth question, how difficult or easy it is to start If I want to enter then what's the process? The process is very simple you only need three document Aadhar Card, PAN Card, and Bank Account are needed. If you don't have then open one. After that nowadays all the process is online. There are many online discount brokers a discount broker is because they take almost zero brokerage. So you don't need to do anything there are many online discount brokers, like Zerodha. Personally I use Zerodha you and also open your account at Zerodha you can find the link in the videos description. In 3-4 days, without any physical paperwork your account will be opened online  and you can start trading. The account opens is Rs-300 and brokerage or commission is zero to none if you are investing. So if you are buying and keeping shares and selling them after two, three days, or more then you don't have to give any commissions. It's almost free. Some little government taxes are there which you will don't even know, because that's less than 0.1%. So I personally use Zerodha because it's very simple to use and very easy for beginners. So go to the description and open a account then after 4 days investing begins. Fifth question, if everything is so good then why share markets name is so bad? Why people fear it? Can I tell you a simple reason this is a mind-set problem. When we buy a property, does anyone thinks in 4 days the price will be doubled and I will sell it out. When someone buys Gold, they pass it on for generations,  but never sells it. No one thinks that, let's buy today then after one month when the price increases I will sell it. So we give property the time to increase we give gold the time to increase. But if your friends say you to come to share market and they will say this too that they made Rs-40,000 in one day, doubled their money in 2 months. Which means their expectations are wrong they come here thinking that, the new people who come that I just have to become rich overnight. You can either become rich overnight by lottery or if you gamble somewhere and  if you are lucky then it can happen. So if you play the share market as a gamble. For the company that you are becoming an owner and buying share of, about that who is the manager? What is their business model? Not finding about that, and just read a chart and heard from someone and bought the shares. Then you will obviously make a loss. So like that, in the rush of making money people buy Rs-1, Rs-2 penny stocks and there is no front and back of that company. Thinking of that if 1 becomes 2 then money doubles. But that 1 to 2 never happens, because the company is not worth it. So the most important this is,  when you are coming into this market don't think this market will make you rich overnight. Like I said, return between 18% to 20% should be expected, if more then it's a bonus. Which means if you get 18% to 20% return then your money will be doubled every 4 years. Which if we compare to Bank FD's then in Bank FDs, it takes 11-12 years to double the money according to today’s interest rates. So compare to that, this market offers 3x times more. Which is enough. Don't be greedier than this. Now you have learned engineering or arts you haven't learned commerce then can you enter in share market? Shall I give you the good news, yes you can? Which is your stream or education background that doesn’t matter. In fact I give you two examples. As I said at the starting of the video. That one time in the US, there was a survey where 10 year old kids, 5th class kids. There were told to pick and basket-like 8-10 shares and at the same time Chartered Accountants were also told that you also pick and basket 8-10 shares. Where Chartered Accountants, very educated in finance and where 10 year old kids. But after 5 years, after seeing whose shares got more returns. Then the Kids outperformed the Chartered Accountants. Now, what do kids know about engineering, commerce, or arts? They know class 5th maths, Hindi, English, and Science. Which you have also learned. So you are also ready to battle Chartered Accountants. Now how did they do that, understand this thing? As they are kind which companies did they choose? Cadbury, Disney, Barby, companies like this which interested them and they are customers of those products. So who knows a product better than a customer. As the kids used their products and picked them which means those companies were satisfying their customers. So that company had to do well, that mostly happens. That's why they outperformed them. Where Chartered Accountants read long balance sheets and did who knows what complicated financial calculations. But didn't see the ground reality. If you are an engineer, then Real-estate, Electrical machines select companies which makes products like this. So select those companies which you can judge and you will do pretty well. One more example in general it's believed that female doctors are the best inventors. Why? They are doctors, they don't have financial knowledge. It's because they are very busy with their lives professional life, personal life, work from home like that. So they don't have time to do the number crunching and complicated financial analysis. They use general knowledge, such as what products I like and second, as there's no time, they invest and forget about it. They invest anything and didn't check for 5-10 years. Because of that transaction cost decreases and compounding, which I mentioned in that SIP calculator shows its full effect. So if you don't know commerce, no problem welcome to the share market. Now I am going to discuss the two most interesting parts of this video. Why do share prices go up and down every day how can you predict when prices increase, when decreasing and why companies are listed in the share market. And second I am going to tell you about my favorite books, websites to learn about investing how did I learn and how can you make a career out of it. But before discussing these two topics this video deserves alike and, What! You haven't subscribed to this channel so press the subscribe button and bell icon so that your knowledge doesn't end here, and you get the next videos and you  keep learning more by investing every week. So let's find out what's this share markets concept and why prices goes up and down. Now see, if you want to start a business if you need little money then family members, relatives, and friends will give you. If you need some more money, then the bank will give you. But you need Rs-20,000 crore. Now bank won't give you that, nor friends or relatives. Unless you form the Ambani family, which many of us aren't. So in this case, who will give you this much money? The public will give you this money. This means you will tell people your business model that this is my plan, I'm going to do this. make this factory, make this car, luxury car it will run on electricity, run on water. But I need money. Now those who trust you will give you money in return, you will get them partisanship in your company because they have put money in you  so you give them partisanship in your company. That partisanship will be called Shares. You took the money and gave shares to those people. Now, this is when companies took money from you and gave you shares. This can happen, that you received a share today and after 2 days you need money and want to sell those shares. The company will not buy those shares from you because they need the money and they started building the car factory with that money now they don't have money to give you. So there should be a market,  where you can give that share to someone else. And we call that market the ""Share Market"". Where you can take shares from 4000 companies, anytime and give back anytime. If you think that Colgate is going to do well their toothpaste and toothbrush are selling more. Then anytime you can take their share from someone else through the share market. And if someone thinks Colgate going to do bad Patanjali will give more competition so they can sell the shares. Because millions of people, everyday are buying and selling a share in the share market. That's why you will always find buyer or seller for your shares, most of the time. And that's the importance of the share market. Just think if you want, you can be a part of Ratan Tata's business by buying a share with one click. If you want, you can buy Adi Godrej's, Godrej empire shares. If you want, you can be a partner of Jio, buying shares with one click. You can buy just 1 share. In just Rs-1500, at least you became a partner of Jio and can say proudly, that Jio is mine. Is everything clear or there is some doubt. You can have any doubts, or want to learn more. No problem, watch this 20 video series where step by step I taught that how prices goes up and down, seeing what you might invest in shares, how can you detect a fraud in a company’s share, don't buy shares expensive, many other things.

"
118,Not Misleading,"so let's say you want to get started  with this investing thing you might have  a bit of money saved it's probably not  enough for a house but you decide you  should probably invest it in something  you could invest in stocks shares  equities government bonds corporate  bonds real estate foreign exchange  crypto nfts Futures Fine Art watches  there seems to be tons of stuff out  there and you might have even seen those  ads on YouTube from the gurus talking  about day trading and trading foreign  exchange and how you could make money in  that way through investing and on top of  all of this confusion there's the very  real fear that you might lose all of  that money that you've worked so hard to  save up so in light of all of that this  is The Ultimate Guide to Investing For  Beginners and we're going to split this  video up into four parts which are going  to be time stamped down below so you can  skip around if you feel like it part one  is going to be about the basics and the  philosophy behind investing part two is  about why and how to invest your money  in stocks and shares in part three we're  going to be addressing common fears and  questions and concerns about investing  like what if I lose all my money and  then in part four we're going to talk  about fast lane investing which is an  alternative approach to the traditional  investing thing to build wealth part one  the philosophy and the basics of  investing so let's start by talking  about what is the point investing the  point of investing is for your money to  be able to make more money so let's say  you start off with a thousand dollars  that you've saved up through your  hard-earned labor now you could put that  money under your mattress or you could  put it in a bank current account but the  problem with that is that there's this  thing called inflation that you might be  reading about on the news and so your  thousand dollars might be able to buy  you a MacBook Air right now but a few  years from now when inflation goes up  that MacBook Air is going to cost twelve  hundred dollars and so over time your  money loses its purchasing power which  is why you want to ideally invest in  something because when you invest in  something your money grows magically on  its own more on that later and that  means you can combat the effects of  inflation and that brings us to the next  question which is how does the money  magically grow in the first place and  generally the philosophy behind  investing is that you buy something now  and that something makes you more money  over time and there are two ways in  which the thing that you buy can make  you more money let's say you buy a house  it costs a certain amount of money to  buy a house right now but there's two  ways the house makes you money number  one you can rent the house out and so  you're getting rental income every month  and secondly hopefully in theory the  value of the house will also rise over  time if you hadn't bought the house and  you just had that money sitting in a  bank account and over time you're going  to be losing money because inflation is  going to eat away at your savings now  houses are an interesting example  because you get rental income and it's  very easy for us to imagine what that  looks like everyone pays rent and so  you're making money but with most other  asset classes you don't have this  equivalent of rental instead a lot of  these things you're buying and then  you're hoping that you can sell them for  a higher price over time the main  exception to this is some stocks and  shares which we're going to talk about a  little bit later in the video and these  asset classes is a long list of things  that you probably have heard of but you  might not be entirely familiar with you  know we've got stocks shares and  equities which are kind of the same  thing we've got hedge funds we've got  index funds we've got bonds government  bonds corporate bonds you might have  heard some people investing in watches  and then fine arts you've probably heard  of people investing in crypto and even  gaining Lots or losing lots in my case  or losing quite a bit of money because  crypto has crashed recently and a lot of  this can get very complicated quite  quickly and so we're going to simplify  things and for the rest of this video  we're going to talk about investing in  stocks and shares because that is the  main kind of investing that normal  people like you and me can unlock fairly  easily you don't need to have large  amounts of money which you need to  invest in a house you don't need to take  on huge amounts of risk and gambling and  stuff like you need to do with crypto  and you don't need to be an accredited  investor or anything like you need to  invest in like ancient investing  companies or all this fun stuff so  stocks and shares are kind of the basics  of investing and usually when people  talk about investing their money what  they're referring to is I want to buy  some Tesla or I want to buy some Netflix  or I want to buy some Amazon and so  we're going to talk about that part two  why and how to invest in stocks and  shares so when you're investing in  stocks and shares for example you're  basically buying a percentage ownership  in the company that you're investing in  so let's say I wanted to buy shares in  Apple for example apple is a publicly  traded company which means the public  can trade Apple stock now in a dream  world I would just be able to go to  apple.com forward slash buy and I'd be  able to buy a stock of Apple and now I  own some percentage of the company in  reality I can't do that directly I have  to go through a middleman which we call  a broker but once I've gone through this  middleman platform I now personally own  a piece of Apple now I can make money  from stocks and shares in two different  ways firstly I could make money because  I'm hoping the price of Apple or  whatever stock I've invested in is gonna  rise over time so 10 years later I could  sell it for a lot more money than I  bought it fingers crossed but the second  way in which you can make money through  stocks and shares is similar to how you  make a rental income on a house because  certain companies will pay what they  call dividends so for example in the UK  there's a company called BT British  Telecom and they pay dividends so when  you own a piece of BT you're not just  hoping that the price will rise over  time they're also literally paying out  some of the profits that the company  makes to their shareholders and so if  for example you were ridiculously rich  and you owned 20 of BT then every time  they declare a dividend which might be  every three months you would get 20 of  the profits that they are Distributing  to shareholders in reality you and me  we're probably not going to own 20 of a  huge company like that because you put  that would cost absolutely billions but  instead we might get you know ten  dollars fifteen dollars twenty dollars  like five dollars 5.47 here and there  and if we invest in lots of companies  that are paying out dividends then it  feels like you've got this free kind of  rental income but really it's profits  from these companies coming into your  account every month and that's pretty  cool so at this point okay cool you can  now buy stocks in these different  companies you can own a small percentage  offset company but how are you supposed  to choose which companies should you put  all your your money in apple or Netflix  or on Disney Plus or should you go with  a shell or British Petroleum or Ralph  Lauren or like I don't know Unilever or  you know these brands that you might be  familiar with now at this point people  have varying different opinions on the  matter but I'm gonna cite Warren  Buffett's opinion on this which is also  my opinion on this which is that if  you're a beginner to investing unless  you are legitimately a financial  professional who literally does this  full-time for a living you should not  try and pick stocks the average person  will not know enough to know which  stocks to buy they won't know enough to  know when to buy them but they don't  have to because if they can buy all of  America through an index fund because  realistically you and me we're not  really going to have an insight into oh  I reckon Apple's going to do really well  because whatever or I reckon Disney's  going to do really well because whatever  there are literally Financial  professionals whose full-time day job it  is to do that kind of analysis and even  then they don't get it right A lot of  the time and so what you can instead do  is instead of worrying about stock  picking what you should do probably not  Financial advice LOL is invest in an  index fund and that begs the question  what the hell is an index one well an  index fund is a fund and a fund is a  basket like a group of stocks and shares  or other things but stocks and shares  for example and the index component  means that this fund tracks a particular  stock market index for example in the US  there is a really famous Index Fund  called the SNP 500 and this is basically  the top 500 biggest companies in the US  and you can see here these are the  components of the S P 500 right now so  Apple makes up 6.4 percent of the S P  500 because it's big company then we've  got Microsoft Amazon alphabet which is  Google Berkshire Hathaway which is  Warren Buffett's company alphabet Class  C which is also Google Nvidia Tesla  Exxon Mobile you might be familiar with  quite a lot of these companies but if we  scroll all the way down to the 500th  company we've got I don't know Ralph  Lauren and Hasbro and didn't realize  Hasbro was in the S P 500 but you can  see that Hasbro makes up 0.21 of the S P  500 compared to Apple's 6.4 because  those companies are hugely different in  I guess market cap or valuation right so  the point of the S P 500 is that it  gives you a single number that you can  graph over time of like how value able  the U.S stock market is because to be  honest most of the value of the U.S  stock market is in these 500 companies  and so if the value of these 500  companies are slowly increasing over  time which It generally does that means  the U.S stock market is doing well and  these companies are doing well and life  is all good if for example you're in a  recession where the stock market is  going down or if for example covert has  just become a thing and the stock market  has gone down that means that  collectively people have decided that  the value of these stocks is lower than  it once was and so the graph will go  down in those moments so what does this  all mean for you and me as normal retail  investors well basically what it means  is we can invest in an index fund so  let's say I put a thousand dollars into  the S P 500 Index Fund that's very good  because it means that my thousand  dollars is now split between 500 of  these companies and crucially it's split  based on the waiting in the S P 500 so  of my 1 000 that I've just put into the  S P 500 6.4 would be in Apple stock and  so now I own 64 worth of Apple stock and  that's pretty cool I now own a bit of  Apple 5.4 of that would be Microsoft so  I now own 54 worth of Microsoft stock  and 0.015 of that is going to be Ralph  Lauren which is for 498th on the S P 500  and so I now own 14 worth of Ralph  Lauren stock now this is a very good  thing and this is what Warren Buffett  recommends my view for most people the  best thing to do is still on the S P  500. he says that hey if you had an  extra hundred thousand dollars to invest  you should just put it straight into the  S P 500 or some other big Index Fund  because over time your money is going to  track the market you're not trying to  say hey I have a crucial insight into  the market and I know that apple is  going to outperform all these other  companies instead you're thinking you  know what I'm just a normal person I  don't have time to spend 80 000 hours a  week trying to research the [ __ ] out of  all this stuff I'm just gonna kind of  diversify my money across all these top  500 big companies in the US I think  overall U.S companies are going to go up  over time and therefore I don't have to  think too hard about this so what's the  alternative well we talked about how you  could theoretically pick stocks yourself  so you could say you know what I'm going  to ignore the S P 500 but chances are  you are not going to beat the market  chances are unless you just get really  lucky you're not going to be real  reliably able to get the returns that  you would get by just investing in all  500 of these companies now there have  been a bunch of studies and surveys and  Warren Buffett even did a challenge  experiment thing about this that  basically show that very few funds  overall actually outperformed the S P  500 and if you've got a fund that beats  the S P 500 I.E it does better in that  year than the S P 500 did it's unlikely  to do the same the following year and so  a lot of these phones are trying to  quote beat the market but as Warren  Buffett and a lot of these other people  say you cannot beat the market so let's  just invest in the market directly just  put your money in an index fund and  don't think too hard about it every  single person I know who has invested by  picking stocks has lost money and every  single person I know who has invested by  just investing in an index fund has made  money over time the next question that  this raises is okay cool I want to  invest in a stock market index fund how  the hell do I do that do I just go on s  p 500.com forward slash buy and buy some  index funds again it's not quite how it  works you need a bit of a middleman and  that's where these kind of online  platforms come in now this is going to  vary depending on whatever country  you're in so if you want to find a  stocks and shares investment platform in  your country then just Google that in  the UK for example there are loads the  ones that I personally use are Charles  Stanley direct because that's the first  one I started using in 2015. I also use  Vanguard Vanguard is super big and super  legit you can check it out and the app  that I use personally for investing in  individual stocks these days is trading  212 and in fact incidentally this video  is now sponsored by trading212 this is  kind of fun as you can tell I'm  recording on a different day anyway if  you want to get started with investing  training212 genuinely is the app that I  use it's the best way to get started you  can trade stocks and shares you can also  open an Isa an individual savings  account if you're in the UK one of the  cool things about trading 212 is you can  practice investing with practice money  so everything about the markets is  identical it's just that you're  investing fake money rather than real  money and if you're uncomfortable  investing real money for now this is a  great way to become more familiar with  the concept of investing and then once  you're ready to invest with real money  you can just switch using a simple  button on the app and you can deposit  money through Apple pay up to two  thousand pounds and then you can use  bank transfer subsequently and the other  cool thing about trading 212 is they've  got this really cool pies feature where  basically you can look on the app and  you can see other investment pies that  other people have created so you'll have  these like Finance Pros that are  creating their custom pies and you'll  see that they've allocated 10 to the s p  or 20 to the ftse 100 or this percenter  apple or Tesla or Microsoft or whatever  and then you can see the performance of  that specific pie over time and then  what you can do if you really want to is  you can copy and paste someone's pie  that they have built into your own  investing account and now you can  automatically with a single click invest  let's say 100 pounds into that pie and  so that 100 pounds will then be split  amongst the various allocations that the  person has decided to do in the pie and  that's great like obviously I'd still  recommend investing in some broad stock  market index fund like the S P 500 even  though I don't give Financial advice  anyway if you fancy giving a go it's  commission free it's completely free to  sign up you don't have to pay anything  you can go to trading212 it's available  on the App Store on iOS and on Android  and if you use the coupon code Ali Ali  when you sign up that will give you a  free share up to the value of 100 pounds  so you can get completely free money by  just signing up for trading 212. check  it out with a link in the video  description or search trading212 on any  of the app stores but thank you so much  trading 212 for sponsoring this video  part three common fears concerns and  questions about investing so if you're  broadly very unlikely to lose money  because Vanguard collapsed overnight but  you might lose money if the value of  your Investments goes down and this is  where people get really really worried  because they always think ah you know if  I invested my pardoned cash into these  stocks and shares what if it goes to  zero what if I lose my money now this is  a common fear and certainly let's say  you invested a thousand dollars into the  S P 500 just before the financial crash  in 2008 and then the markets crashed by  I don't know 60 or whatever it was and  so now your thousand dollars is worth  like 400 I know you're thinking oh my  God like I can't believe I've lost 60 of  my money now if at that point you sell  now you have realized the loss now  you've literally lost money because you  bought the thing for a thousand and you  sold it for 400. but if you just held on  then the market recovered over time and  by 2012 it was at the same levels and  then it was just going up and up and up  so even if you had invested lots of  money just before the 2008 financial  crisis if you had just stuck to your  guns and left that money in there you'd  be have you'd have doubled or tripled or  something your money by now because  overall the stock market broadly goes up  over a long enough time Horizon it's the  same with house prices you can buy a  house and if you try and sell it next  week then maybe the price will have gone  down but if you try and sell it 20 years  from now chances are unless your country  has been destroyed the price will have  gone up and the longer you can leave  your money in these index funds or  whatever the more it compounds over time  and as Einstein is famously put reported  to have said compound interest is the  eighth wonder of the world what are the  chances that all 500 of the biggest  companies in the US suddenly are going  to drop to zero value overnight  basically zero percent I think if all  500 of the biggest companies in the US  all have their value dropped to zero I'm  we're going to have bigger problems in  the world than the value of my stock  market portfolio and the reason why I  think it's reasonable to make the bet  that over time the stock market goes up  is because every day thousands of people  are going to work in each of these  companies every single day value is  being created by the employees at Apple  they're researching new technology  they're building new stuff they're  adding an extra camera or an extra lens  to the iPhone and all of that means that  because these people are putting in the  input of human labor you would expect  the value of the company to rise with  time because they're making more and  more cool stuff and because people are  going to want to continue to buy that  more and more of that cool stuff now  another question people sometimes have  is how much money do I need to get  started do I need to be like super rich  to start investing and the answer is no  again it depends on which platform  you're using but for example I'm trading  212 or Vanguard and Vanguard I think you  just need 100 pounds to invest trading  212 I think you can start with like 5  again this is just massively varies  depending on your country so do some  research and figure out what are the  most reputable and legit Platforms in  your country and then you can invest  based on that now there's two other  categories of stuff that I invest in I  invest in real estate so I've got a few  properties in the portfolio we're not  going to talk about that because I've  done a video about that over there  buying versus renting and that's usually  outside the range for most people until  you've already made a lot of money to be  able to afford a deposit on a house and  get a mortgage and I also invest some  amount of money in crypto yep and as we  can see here the total value of my  crypto portfolio is 200 000 but I have  actually lost 65 000 so I've put in 265k  into crypto and currently it's worth  200k what can you do I'm hoping the  price Rises with time so generally when  it comes to recommending investing in  crypto people often ask about this I  would say if you want to take the gamble  fine but make sure the only money you're  putting into your crypto account is  money that you can 100 afford to lose  don't try and think of investing in  general or crypto in particular as a get  rich quick scheme but generally if you  want to invest your money in stocks and  shares as Warren Buffett says and as I  do and as I generally recommend even  though I'm not a financial advisor not  Financial advice Etc it's pretty  reasonable to put that money in a stock  market index fund like the S P 500 for  example by the way if you're enjoying  this video so far I'd love to hear in  the comments what's been your biggest  concern about getting started with  investing what is the thing that's  holding you back part 4 fast lane  investing the alternative approach to  Building Wealth so so far we've talked  about what some people would somewhat  disparagingly called the call the slow  lane approach to Building Wealth it's  like the slow lane and this and there's  the fast lane now this is terminology  from MJ DeMarco's book of the  millionaire fast language it's actually  a really good book but the basic idea of  slow lane investing is that hey I've got  some money I'm gonna do my day job I'm  Gonna Save up 10 of my paycheck and  every month I'm gonna put 10 into my  savings account and then I'm going to  invest that money in the S P 500 and  then 50 years from now by the time I'm  65 that money will have compounded and  then I'll Be A Millionaire this is a  very very slow form of investing it's a  very slow way to build wealth and  certainly it's fine to invest in stock  market index funds I do that as well but  there is another approach to investing  and it's worth talking about that here  because when we hear investing a lot of  us just default to thinking oh I guess I  should buy stocks and shares or I guess  I need to buy a house but if we really  think about it what is the point of  investing money the point of investing  money is for your existing money to make  more money further down the line that's  all the point is the point is not to  invest in stocks and shares stocks and  shares are a vehicle by which you can  turn your money into more money further  down the line but when it comes to Fast  Lane investing fast lane investing is  basically that instead of investing in  someone else's business I.E apple or  Amazon or Google or whatever you're  investing instead in yourself and in  your own business the S P 500 goes up by  seven percent each year again on average  so if I put a thousand dollars into the  S P 500 it would be worth on average one  thousand and seventy dollars twelve  months from now and so the question  becomes can I do something better with  that thousand dollars to make more than  seventy dollars in the next 12 months  and generally the answer is hell yes  there are kind of two things I could  invest in I could invest in my own  ability to make money so for example  let's say I'm a healthcare assistant in  a hospital and I can take a course for a  hundred pounds and that course gives me  the ability to become a phlebotomist  someone who takes blood and let's say  I'm making 15 pounds an hour as a  healthcare assistant but I could be  making 25 pounds an hour as a  phlebotomist now all of a sudden I've  paid 100 pounds I've invested 100 pounds  into my own skills but I've been able to  increase my earning capacity by nearly  2X and therefore within four hours of  working as a phlebotomist I will have  paid off my hundred pound investment and  now if I work as a phlebotomist instead  of a healthcare assistant I'm now  earning more than 10 pounds an hour and  so every 10 hours of the work that I do  I'll be earning that hundred pounds back  and so my return on this hundred pounds  is way way way higher than just seven  percent because I fundamentally  increased my own value to the market  I've fundamentally increased my own  ability to make money this is why  investing in your own education is  generally a very reasonable thing to do  yes you can find out lots of stuff on  YouTube and I'm always in favor of like  hey if you're broke don't buy fancy  courses don't take out loans to buy  courses find free information on the  internet but I've got so many friends  who have an extra few thousand pounds  and they put it in the S P 500 because  they're hoping it'll grow over the next  50 years rather than just spending some  money on a weekend course on whatever  skill they want to improve and then they  can use that skill to literally make way  way more money than they would by just  sticking in the S P 500 so that's kind  of one way of Fast Lane investing you  invest in your own ability to make money  but the other way of Fast Lane investing  is by investing in your own business  obviously this only applies if you have  a business want to start a business but  generally the way to get rich quickly  quickly as in the next 10 years rather  than the next 70 years is to build your  own business to own your own business  and to increase the value of that  business rather than giving your money  to Apple or to Tesla so for example if I  wanted to I could start my own coffee  shop or my own online business or my own  YouTube channel which is a business if I  wanted to I could start my own web  design agency or social media marketing  agency if I wanted to I could learn how  to code and I could build software and I  could turn it into an app I back myself  to be able to make a business and teach  myself the basics of how to run that  business and make that business more  valuable in terms of return percentage  then the seven percent I would get in  the S P 500 and when I interviewed Alex  for Mosey who's like a 200 million  dollar entrepreneur he call he kind of  calls it in investing in the s p versus  investing in the sne it's a whole S P  500 versus SME 500 but like you will get  a significantly higher return investing  in your own ability to make make money  then you will in any any market and his  advice as well is that you should invest  in the sne you should invest in yourself  invest in your own skills invest in your  own ability to make money invest in your  own business because the Returns on that  are way more likely to be ridiculously  higher than just that crappy seven  percent that you get by investing in the  S P 500 so if for example you are  interested in investing in your own  education and you want to start a  YouTube channel and really take it  seriously and treat it like a business  you might like to check out my own  course part-time YouTuber Academy it's  great people love it it's good vibes  that'll be linked down below and that  course is basically about teaching you  the things you need to know to systemize  and scale a YouTube channel if you want  to treat it like a business it's not a  course for people who want to do it as a  hobby but if like me you want to turn  your channel into a business and make  money that way that's a course that  might help you but of course everything  is available on YouTube for free as well  so if you're broke or if you have loads  of time and not much money then of  course you can find all this information  for free on the internet anyway I hope  you found this video useful if you're  interested in learning more about this  fast lane investing approach to Building  Wealth you should check out this video  here which is my book review of the  millionaire fast lane by MJ DeMarco  which is the best book I've ever read on  how to make money in a quick fashion  quick meaning in the next 10 years  rather than the next 60 years so check  out that video over there thank you so  much for watching and I'll see you  hopefully in the next video

119,Not Misleading,"you are young I'm 17 years old you're  ambitious I worked my face off and you  want to make it big early in your life  so in today's video I'm going to reveal  the seven principles for teenagers and  people in their early 20s to become  millionaires now I made my first million  dollars at 18 years old and no matter  what you see on Tick Tock I want you to  know that that is not normal it is not  normal in any shape form or fashion but  it is because I followed these seven  principles so what I'm going to reveal  to you today not only helped me make my  first million dollars at 18 years old it  has helped me to amass a net worth of  tens of millions of dollars by the age  of 23. so I'm speaking from experience  here but I do want to make it clear that  no matter what anyone says I will hold  my hand up and say that a very large  portion of why I'm in the position I am  today is because of luck or the grace of  God in my opinion and timing so just  factor that in now real quick before we  get into today's video I've had tons of  people over the years ask me to do like  q and A's on Instagram or even here on  YouTube where I answer questions to  people's specific cases you know their  particular question and I'll be honest  my main Instagram is just a stupid place  where I post photo dumps from trips  business trips what's going on in my  life stuff like that but earlier this  year I created an Instagram account  called at talk with Eman so you can just  pull up your phone and request to follow  that account I usually tell my team to  let in a thousand or two thousand people  a week I try my best okay I'll hold my  hands up sometimes I do miss it I try my  best to do a weekly q a just answering  all of your guys's business life  questions so go ahead and follow that  account if you want a little bit more  business advice but apart from that  let's get back into the video the first  principle you need to learn if you want  to be a millionaire in your teens or  your early 20s is that in order to be a  king you must first be a pawn and this  is really the issue with this generation  and I say this generation even though I  am included in it but I grew up with  very traditional principles around  respect I come from a background that is  a mix between Eastern European and  Middle Eastern so like growing up you  have no option you learn respect and you  learn the pecking order and I learned  from a young age that you respect your  elders and that's why still to the state  I still sit across the table from people  that I'm gonna be very honest with you  are far less successful than I am but I  shut the [ __ ] up and I listen because  for me in my culture you listen to your  elders now that doesn't mean you need to  take everything that they say on board  but you at least listen and because I  grew up in this environment of learning  respect I learned that hey you can be a  king one day but in order to be a king  you first need to be a pawn you first  need to be able to earn your stripes and  by the way I earned my stripes from a  very young age I started my first  entrepreneurial Ventures when I was 14  and I learned what it was like to work  with clients and quite frankly for a  lack of a better word be their little  [ __ ] boy I learned what it was like to  pay my dues no matter what it's kind of  like listen when you're young and you  join a football team you're going to be  the one who's the ball boy at the end of  training you're going to be the one who  is expected to carry all of the  equipment to and from and you need to go  through that to one day become the  captain you don't just come in  especially as someone who is Young and  become the captain all of a sudden and  that is the issue with today's social  media [ __ ] Society they look at  things and they look at people and they  go okay I'm going to jump from here to  here and I deserve that for some reason  and I even get this to this day people  say hey man why do you recommend  business models that you used to do why  don't you recommend what you're doing  right now do you realize how stupid that  sounds do you realize why I may suggest  business models I did when I first  started my entrepreneurial Ventures or  within three years into my  entrepreneurial Ventures not now that I  am coming up to my 10th year as an  entrepreneur do you not realize why I  would suggest businesses that I started  as a pawn as someone with no resources  no connection no money nothing do you  realize why I suggest those businesses  rather than the businesses I have now  with millions of followers subscribers  tens of millions of dollars like I'm  sure you can kind of see why I think  this is better than this but this is  what I'm saying the younger generation  they look at things and they're like no  I want to jump straight to the Finish  Line you have to earn your [ __ ]  Stripes so just remember to be a king  you must first learn to be a pawn and  there is an nothing wrong with that by  the way there is honor there is no  ability in starting from the bottom of  the pecking order being quiet respecting  the process and understanding that you  will eventually work your way up the  totem pole now the next principle for  teenagers to become millionaires is  dressed to elevate and here's what I  mean by that when you are young people  are going to automatically discredit you  you don't want to make it worse by the  way that you dress so here's the thing  you can have a 30 year old that dresses  in big labels Gucci Balenciaga where's  the funny shoes and all that stuff and  listen I mean I'm not against it  sometimes when I'm feeling comfortable I  dress in streetwear but if I'm going to  an important meeting I can guarantee you  I'm not dressed like that and my point  is that you can get a 30 year old that  dresses like that that looks like a 20  year old whereas you can get a 18 or 20  year old that dresses very traditional  very classic and you can get an 18 or 20  year old that looks like they're 30. so  the point is don't spend crazy amounts  of money to have all these labels and  this and that and I don't think that's a  good idea ever unless you really can  afford ordered you have a full wardrobe  and sometimes you just want to be a  little playful my best recommendation is  just go for clothes that have no  branding No Label and I'm not saying  that you need to dress in three-piece  suits listen even if you just go in a  simple black T-shirt simple trousers  that aren't too baggy and definitely no  skinny jeans and just some classic  Timeless shape shoes listen you're not  dressing incredibly well but the point  is you can kind of hold your own in any  room sometimes less really is more so  first learn how to just dress classic  and Timeless and then later down the  line you can start incorporating some  suits you can start incorporating some  double-breasted suits maybe before you  go to the suits just get some nice  Blazers and you compare the Blazers with  trousers it doesn't need to be a full  suit you know a lot of times I'm just  very comfortable with a nice round neck  t-shirt not like this this is a lot more  you know it's a Sunday today a very home  comfortable shirt so not something as  casual as this just a nice fitted white  T-shirt or black T-shirt and smart  Blazer over the top some trousers and  some smart shoes and you have a very  classic Timeless look that's not overly  formal and you're never going to be too  overdressed in any situation and then as  I said later down the line you can get  into your double-breasted so you can get  into your three pieces whatever you feel  comfortable in really but the point is  that you really need to learn how to  dress to elevate especially if you're  going into the world of business at a  young age because I'm being honest with  you I experience this firsthand people  will try to discredit you because of  your age so don't give them any excuse  or Reason to make it an even bigger  thing than it needs to be so dress older  than you are now the third principle for  teenagers to become millionaires is have  something external that humbles you and  here's what I mean by that there's a lot  of people who are young with a lot of  ambition in their life but the issue is  there's nothing in their life that has  humbled them things that will humble you  Combat Sports business will humble you  because no matter how good you are when  you get in the world of business the  market will tell you how good you are  I'll give you a perfect example I  remember when I was 17 years old I had  gone up to I think 15 or 20 grand in my  business at that point I dropped out of  school the month prior and I hired my  first employee full-time employee fifty  thousand dollars a year which by the way  for a first employee was like at 17 that  was big for me and I'll never forget it  this person even moved country to join  my company AKA just me and within three  to four days he quit packed up his stuff  and went back to his country and was  like I do not enjoy this work and I  remember it was one of the very few  times I've ever cried in my life I  remember talking to my mom and just  crying and just being like wow I feel  like a failure your business is taking  off and you're hiring your first  employee and they leave because a the  work isn't enjoyable enough or  potentially and this is something I had  to face at the time maybe I just really  wasn't an inspiring leader maybe I  wasn't a sort of leader where my team  was like I would follow you into war and  things are very different now that I  have 150 employees we get 40 000 people  a year applying to work at one of my  companies because I was humbled when I  was 17 that hey maybe you're not as good  as you think you are maybe you think  that you're this little child prodigy  are you sure about that let me humble  you so whether it's business whether  it's Combat Sports you need something  external in your life to Humble you and  put you in your place because the thing  is especially if you earn a lot of  success at a young age you're gonna  start to think you're hot [ __ ] and if  you don't have anything to Humble you  you will end up becoming your worst  enemy the next principle you need to  follow is no casual dating either  something serious or nothing at all  listen if you are in your teenage years  or your early 20s either you go for  something serious no casual dates no  casual flings stuff like that listen you  are a man in your early years make  something of yourself and either have a  partner early on they will support you  through that as something serious or  none of this casual hinge Tinder blah  blah all this none of this casual dating  because let me tell you something it is  taking you away from your best years  your best years to build and the other  thing is we live in a very brutal dating  culture I'm gonna be very honest with  you so why b19 trying to navigate this  crazy difficult dating culture where  there's successful men all around the  world that through Instagram and all of  these other mediums have access to all  these women why would you at 19 try to  compete with that either you have that  serious girl that holds it down for you  or don't try to casual date if you want  a casual date and have your fun and  listen I'm speaking to someone who has  had both sides of the equation into the  state I still like to have my fun  there's nothing wrong with it but I put  my head down and work like a dog for  years and years and I remember even  being 19 20 and being a  multi-millionaire and I said to myself  what's the point of me really focusing  on women and having fun and enjoying  myself with all these women when girls  don't want guys for 19 or 20 and you  need to understand this as a guy you  become most attractive once you get past  the age of 25 really from 25 to 35 is  when you're most attractive to women and  it really only starts at 25. so I  remember even being 19 or 20 and I'm  like yes this is great I'm a  multi-millionaire I'm all these things  but like let me just keep working like  I'm on a roll like all momentum let me  just keep this going rather than trying  to have the most fun and date girls and  Bubba and all this crap so as I said no  casual dating either you are dating  someone serious that you're like this  woman could be that day one for me and  by the way that day one girl listen  please take this coming from me there is  nothing on Earth nothing on earth that  is more viable than that if you've got a  day one girl and you managed to get a  day one girl you know all these girls on  a y'all private job I have done and  still do all these things but I  understand that that does not come  remotely close to a day one girl who is  there from you from the jump from day  one so either aim for that because by  the way that is the most valuable thing  you could ever get in life I'm telling  you this so either you get that or just  don't casual date because you are in  your building phase you have so long  especially as a man and I know I keep  talking to men and I understand that  there's a I think 10 of my audience is  women and I always do say I make content  specifically for men because I grew up  without a dad I had to learn all this  myself so that's why I speak to the  young men out there but I know a lot of  women still watch my videos and take  lessons from it and stuff like that so  as I was saying keep your head down keep  focused no casual dating [ __ ] and  then once you've made something of  yourself pop your head up and and then  you can have a little bit of fun before  eventually hopefully one day you find  your actual Queen principle number five  is keep your circles small but your  influence large and here's what I mean  by that there is nothing wrong with many  people knowing you or with you having  many acquaintances but you should have  very few friends and here's the thing  most people in this [ __ ] fake life  don't know the difference between an  acquaintance and a friend because most  people don't understand what true  loyalty is they are around people that  they don't like they're around people  for clout or money and this and that and  that's why by the way it's so important  to get yourself strong first so this way  people later down line can't throw money  or women or clout at you and you're  impressed by it you need to make  yourself strong you need to make  yourself a fortress but back to the  point keep your circle tight but you're  influence large many people can and  should know of you and I'm not talking  about having a massive social media  following or this or that I just mean  even in the industry you're in never  unnecessarily burn Bridges always be  very polite and courteous to people but  always understand that you can probably  only have a select handful of true  friends true Brothers in Arms true  people that will love you and do  anything for you that's a very very  small circle so your circle of influence  can and should be large but keep your  actual Circle solid and full of good  people the next principle you need to  follow is that God will always test you  to see what you can handle and if you  can't he will take it away from you and  this is very very important because  becoming successful and making your  first million in your teens or your  early 20s that's great congratulations  can you keep it now and not only can you  keep it can you multiply it because  that's a lot of pressure listen if you  make your first million dollars when  you're 18 or you're 20 or you're you  know even 23 that's great but that's a  lot of pressure every year after that  can you hold that same standard so you  need to understand that God If He  blesses you if he gives you that million  at a young age he's gonna see if you can  handle it he's gonna see if you can  humble yourself that's why earlier I  told you have things external in your  life that will constantly humble you  business martial arts setting challenges  for yourself and seeing if you can  accomplish things that really make you  dig deep because here's the thing if you  don't have these external things to  Humble you if you don't humble yourself  God will humble you and when God humbles  you it's with a ferocity you can't even  imagine because you're not ready for it  yet as quickly as it's given it's taken  away and you need to understand these  things so as long as you go into it with  a mindset that when you make your first  million you're not going to be driving  around in the G-Wagon and you're gonna  go to the bank like a idiot and take out  thirty thousand dollars in cash so that  way you can do an Instagram story where  you spread all the money in your hands  and now all you do is listen to little  baby in your rented G-Wagon and pop  bottles at the beach club and now your  business is just on autopilot God will  put you in your place so before that  happens put other things in place I've  already given a few but even if you can  get an older Mentor an older Confidant  to look at you and be like you ain't  doing it once is nothing special you're  only a legend if you can do it back to  back to back that's when you're a legend  now the last principle to tie it all  together is invest early and invest as  much as you can here is the thing if you  make money at a young age try to get  away from you as soon as possible I'm  talking about property I'm talking about  maybe even buying some physical gold I'm  talking about things where the money can  get away from you and it's not easy to  sell here's the issue sometimes and I'm  not totally opposed to it here's  sometimes the issue with crypto or  stocks you can buy and sell very easily  you can't buy and sell real estate very  easily so buying things that aren't  actually very liquid at a young age I  think later down the line once you're  established that can actually be a  detriment actually makes things a little  bit more difficult but when you're a  young age you are your worst enemy  you're the probably the biggest reason  you're gonna [ __ ] this up so what you  want to do is once you make money push  it away as quick as possible because  here's the other thing and once again  I'm talking from experience when you are  young and you make a lot of money you  know what people think people don't  think oh well done people think you got  lucky so there's no point being 19 years  old driving all these supercars and blah  blah all this stuff because you're not  impressing anyone people just think  you're lucky that's it you're better off  taking the money investing it and when  you're 23 you're 25 you get to an age  where people can kind of believe this  has happened a little bit more maybe you  know you're 22 but you're dressed apart  and people think you're a little older  and that's when you can enjoy and you  can live it up and you can do these  things because when you get out of your  Supercar people will actually think that  you bought that but when you're 19 and  you look young people will either think  you got lucky they're going to think you  invest in some pump and dumb coin or  they're gonna think Daddy's money so  while you're trying to flex and let's be  honest if you're young and you're buying  these supercars you're probably trying  to flex it's not even having the  intended effect so just tell yourself  you know what any money that comes in  I'm gonna invest as much as I humanly  can I'm gonna make myself solid and I'm  gonna enjoy these things a little later  down the line so ladies and gentlemen I  present to you these principles as  someone who can speak to you more  realistically because let's be honest a  lot of these YouTube videos you watch  online are some 50 year olds that lived  in a different generation and don't  understand that hey there's nothing  wrong with wanting beautiful women  around you there's nothing wrong with  wanting money having nice cars all these  things there's nothing wrong with that  but there's a way to do it there's a  time and a place so I'm just coming here  and speaking to you guys from experience  and trying to meet you guys of where you  are which is not trying to shame you for  the things you want in life but just  telling you there is a way to do it and  there's a right timing to do things so  as I said I hope this has been a value  to you as a reminder I'm a little bit  more active on that talk with Iman for  actual sort of business q and A's so go  ahead and follow that account and as  always I'm watching from afar and I'm  rooting for you

So if you also want to maximize your  profits and want to  learn the secrets of option trading, then I would like to introduce  you to Mr. One and  Only Vinay Prakash Tiwari. Sir, welcome to our GoSelfmade Show.  Many thanks to all of you, I welcome all of you, I welcome everyone,  I hope everyone is  enjoying life. Sir, there are many people who know you, definitely,  and there are many  people who are my audience who do not know you yet. So first  of all, every person has  a curiosity that if I am introducing someone for the first time,  then people should know  about them. So who can tell you better about you, how did you  start, how did you get here  and what theories did you work on? So how was the journey from  the very beginning, please  guide people. The journey from the beginning was that we started  as a trader, as a dealer,  dealer means that we went back 10 years from today in the previous  time, so this online  mobile trading did not work that much, so dealers used to sit  at specific brokers, so  I used to work at a sub-broker as a dealer, so the work of trade  punch used to happen,  I started from there and slowly understanding the market, when  I started investing in the  market, I came to know what is the bitter truth of this market  and the bitter truth  is that it is a simple thing that you are taking a trade, initiated  a trade and went  straight to that trade and hit a stop loss and that stop loss  comes straight to the knife  and hits the heart. Because in people's minds, one thing happens  that we have taken a trade,  either we have a target or we have a stop loss, right? But most  people have a stop loss.  So what work did you do on it? Okay, before this, we will definitely  talk about working  on the stock market, but did you have any education or study  on the stock market? Whatever you  learned, did you learn it when you were doing dealership? Yes,  whatever I did, I mean, the  start of the stock market started with dealership. Which year  was it? How many years ago? This  is the year 2009 and 10, when Lehman Brothers fell, this is just  after that, when we started  seeing the market. From that, a lot of market came in the news,  we started knowing about  the market, started reading, started learning, started learning  from a very late time, started  learning. I started after making a loss. Okay, so when did you  start making a loss? I started  making a loss when I started trading. After 2010, I started trading  when I saw people  that they come, so much money is made. I also wanted to do it,  why not? So people used to  suffer losses, didn't you see that? Where do you see losses?  The first thing you see is  profit, whose profit is it? We put the loss in the subconscious  mind slowly and send it  back. You don't see losses. How does anyone get attracted? Its  white part is attracted  by the dark part. Its dark part is not attracted there. We deliberately  close our eyes. So  where did you start trading, derivative trading, how did you  start trading? In the beginning,  we did trading in cash. And the first time when I traded, believe  me, I tell you how the  feeling comes. The first time you take a trade, initiate a trade,  and in the first trade,  I got 498 rupees, something 500 rupees, and that was a profit.  500 rupees. And when 500  rupees came, I felt that 500 rupees can be earned so easily.  It is very easy, it has  been done very well. And it started from here, then it gradually  converted into addiction.  So you started trading in cash, after that 500 rupees came, profit  came, then what happened?  Started trading in cash, then gradually started investing it,  then after a few days, the options  of Bank Nifty were introduced in the index. Options of Bank Nifty  were introduced. This  year, 2016? No, it's about 12-13, it's about that time. When  the index of the options of  Bank Nifty came, then the options, at that time, the American  market was known more, the  American market was understood, the whole game of writers was  there, the game of buyers  was less there. So, I started understanding them. I mean, I got  interested in it, that  there is something like a derivative, something like that, future.  So you used to trade in  futures too? No, I didn't trade in futures, I used to trade only  in cash, I used to do  intraday trading in cash. And positional, since then, I have  kept a lot of stocks, gradually  I kept that and left it, that I took all the things for myself.  I understood this from  the beginning that I don't have to keep all the things for myself,  some things are to  be given to the coming generation, so I have been saving stocks  since then, I have been  saving them. So, when the options were introduced, when I started  understanding the options,  started understanding the derivatives, then I felt that yes,  I went to read, I searched  some websites, searched some US websites, saw some Khangala,  understood, then I understood  that these are some calculative things, where the calculations  are more, like we do trading  in the market, so it is simple, buy at a cheap price and sell  at an expensive price, it is  very simple. There is no calculation, it is a simple thing, this  is a stock of 100 rupees,  bought it, it went to 105, sell it, if it went to 101, sell it,  that money is yours. But  when we came to derivatives, then it was seen in derivatives  that there are a lot of Greeks  in it, delta, theta, vega, gamma, rho, these are simple normal  Greeks, apart from this,  there are minor Greeks. So what did we do to them? Each of them  has its own calculation.  So when I started understanding that, and this is basically a  reverse calculation, how  is reverse calculation? I will tell you, many times people ask  me, reverse calculation  means that when I started looking at the market, then I understood  that the market runs, so  there are some behind the scenes calculations in it. So the first  calculation I saw in  my life was the calculation of black and shawls, where we can  calculate the prices of options,  can convert the spot price into options. Looking at that calculation,  I felt that there  must be some more calculations here, I used to come there by  writing. Now when I used to  see the market, what was the first thing I experienced? I had  the experience of delta.  How? I saw the market, I saw the price of the future, and I added  these two prices, added  it, added it, added it, added it, and I got a value. I did not  know that this is delta,  I did not know at all. I got a value, saw that value, and then  I found out that the  market moves at the same value as this value, a little less or  more than that. So I understood  that there is some value, I found it, I found something in the  market, I am very happy.  Later I found out that this is called delta. People have been  using it for many years.  People have been using it for many years. This happens many times.  We think that we  have found something, someone was researching it earlier. So  from there, I found other things,  I calculated theta myself. Then I made a habit that I will not  go to see anyone's formula,  I will find it myself and calculate it. Yes, someone says that  I have found a hammer,  whenever this kind of calculator is made in the market, then  this happens. This happens.  Someone is telling that this is the right thing. So then I made  that habit and then I started  understanding those calculations. Then the market slowly started  to understand that the  market works like this. So have you studied anything in mathematics?  No, I have not studied  any such thing in mathematics. I am an arts graduate, so I am  very far from mathematics.  Then where did it come from that I have to go into calculations?  This is, suppose you have started seeing something, you felt  challenged by that thing,  as it happens that we are playing a game. Now if you are playing  a game, then that stage  is not crossing. Now it is not crossing, although I have other  important work, but I left that  other important work and then where did I go? I came back to  the game and played the game  again that I have to cross this stage. So that interest from  there, my friends still  think that the person who left mathematics after 10th grade because  of the fear that  he will have to do calculations, that person has gone so deep  in calculators and calculations  that people all over India are knowing him. No, no, absolutely.  In today's rate, if I  look at myself, then we keep looking at the option chain and  doing our analysis, keep  doing calculations and in fact I had no special interest in mathematics,  but there is interest  in money. Numbers are the best in the account, in the account  balance. Is it with you?  Absolutely. Numbers look good there. Either a girl gives number  for the first time,  so either that number looks good or. Now see, after getting married,  that time has gone  far behind. No, no, that was sometime. Sometime. Sometime. Anyway,  so sir, you have very  humble beginnings from where I found out that you are going to  live in Varanasi. Yes, yes,  absolutely. So what happens is that today's date someone is from  Bombay or from some  city, so he has a lot of resources, there are people, so we are  talking about Varanasi,  very good people are moving forward in today's rate, but was  there any challenge for you?  Terrible, not just a challenge, I mean the father of challenges  was standing. Like what?  Like when you are in Varanasi, suppose you have told someone  that I do not work, I do  not do a job, I left the job, now I was doing this by leaving  the job, so you told someone  that I do not do a job, so what do you do? So I do stock market,  I do trading in the  stock market. Okay, so that is kind of gambling. Yes, you are  gambler. Then that thing spreads  from there, in the neighborhood, from the neighborhood, in the  whole neighborhood and  from the whole neighborhood, that he is a gambler. Yes, yes,  absolutely. Now I, it is a matter  of a few days ago, so I was doing something, what happened is  that I went somewhere and  I sat in the car. So why did I sit in the car? Because it was  expiry, my position is  big, I have to do a secure off, so I sat there and I am not doing  anything, I drove the car,  I sat in the back seat and whatever calculations I am doing and  working on my laptop, so many  people started looking from outside, I was busy in this, I was  looking, so outside people  were looking that there is no one in the driving seat, how is  the car on? So he came and saw  what are you doing? This is my work, so this is my work. So people  find it very strange  that this is also a work of people.  a kind of a work,  with which you will make regular money.  Until this financial education does not become the base, I always  talk about the base.  Base means what is filled in our mind since childhood.  You have to study to become a doctor, you have to study to become  an engineer.  Right.  Now think that for the last 10-15 years, sports and other things  have started happening,  258 0:10:22,800 --> 0:10:03,953 So even today in India, people don't believe that this is also  guardians have started doing, but before that you had only two  ways.  How were we? When we used to study, it was simple.  If he took maths, it means he is the most brilliant person.  Right.  If he left maths and took bio, then that is also fine.  If he took commerce, then it is average.  And if he took arts by mistake, then it is a burden on his life.  Such things, such mentality.  Now on all this, if you talk to a child from childhood that you  want to become a trader or an investor,  then this is not the thought of anyone.  Not of anyone.  Parents say that my son will study and become a doctor, my son  will study and become an engineer.  What I say is, let's say your plan is successful, your son has  studied and become a doctor,  then how will he manage the money he earns?  Hmm.  How many, you see for yourself, how many, you are in this field,  I am in this field, we know,  how many financial frauds are happening, are they happening only  to illiterate people?  No, no, educated people.  Look, they are happening to well educated people.  Why? Because their financial background is very weak.  They have not understood that thing.  They are in their plan A.  Someone takes a wrong policy, the bank gives a slip, they do  not know in which plan they are being invested for the past 5  years.  And it will not be beneficial to them.  But okay.  I just met one person.  He told that for the past 6-7 years, almost 90% of his salary  is being invested in a particular SIP.  Now he is not at fault that I am investing in SIP, you should  get a return in SIP.  He said that I am getting very less returns.  So, the way I explained to him, I found out that the regular  plans that used to run,  which did not have a cap before, cap means that whenever an agent  gives you a plan or a direct plan,  there was no capping before that how much commission will go  to that agent.  Right.  So, in such a plan, an agent had made his investment and he is  saying that I have been investing for 7 years and I have no return.  I am getting almost the same amount of money as I have given.  So, what is the reason for this?  Now he is an engineer in the designation.  He is doing everything, he is working hard, but I don't know  who he is going to get all the hard work.  This knowledge is very important.  So, sir, your journey must be understood to a large extent by  people.  But now it comes that those people who are new, now there is  interest in options, they are learning,  they are trading, but there are many things that they need to  learn from you.  So, now we will talk about those topics.  Absolutely.  In these topics, see, first of all, let's talk from the beginning.  Beginning in the sense that what do we need first of all?  First of all, we need to understand our mistakes.  There are many types of people.  Some people are buying options, some people are writing options.  Buying people are buying on their own theories.  Writing people are writing on their own theories.  Leave the theories, 99% of the traders in India are either trading  on the trust of others.  Some people say take tips from a telegram guy, some people say  take tips from an advisory guy,  some people say sit a parrot, say parrot, buy, buy, sell, sell.  So, people are doing all these things, I mean, they are doing  it in their own way.  But where do we get the matter?  Where do we get the parrot?  That parrot is found in our mind.  So, see what happens is that when we go to trade, when we are  trade specific, then we are calculated.  See, it is important to take risks in the market.  It is not that you will not have losses, you will have losses,  you will always have losses.  Do not be afraid of these losses.  Do not be afraid in the sense that when you take calculated risk,  you will not be afraid of losses.  Like when we are taking random trades, I made a profit or I made  a loss in random trades,  then I can only see those numbers.  Seeing numbers means that if I did minus 10,000 rupees, then  it is a number, minus 10,000 rupees.  And if I did plus 10,000, then it is a number.  I do not know why I made this loss.  I do not know why I made this profit.  It is simple.  But when you take calculated risk, then you know what mistakes  you have made,  so next time you will not make those mistakes.  So, I start with these things.  We will start straight.  The first question in people's minds is that when we are trading  in options,  I can understand your viewers up to this point,  or those who are watching us can understand up to this point  that they buy call outputs in options,  we do not go to basics.  Now, let's go from here that if they are buying a call option  or a put option,  then what are the initial mistakes they make?  The first mistake in those mistakes is the strike price selection.  How to select the right strike price?  And how to select it correctly with calculations?  How can we understand that?  So, if we talk about the option chain, simply if you type on  Google, Nifty option chain.  So, when we click on the option chain of the National Stock Exchange,  then what we see here is the data of the National Stock Exchange  option chain.  Now, many of our viewers may be watching this data for the first  time in their life.  There will be many people who watch it regularly.  There will be many people who think that it is updated at the  end of the day.  There are many people who know that it is updated every 3 minutes.  So, whatever it is, there is a way to see the option chain.  There is a way to understand any trade.  When I see the option chain or when I talk about the option chain,  then I want us to see and understand this option chain in parts.  Seeing and understanding in parts means that the first thing  we will start with is with these strike prices.  When you are looking at any option chain, you can see the data  of calls on the left-hand side.  You can see the data of puts on the right-hand side and all the  strike prices in the middle.  What do I consider these strike prices in my theories?  I consider these strike prices as a stage.  You have a pause. The market stops at these strike prices.  At every strike price.  This strike price comes after specific numbers in each stock.  Like Nifty comes after 50 points.  Bank Nifty comes after 100 points.  Now, when we start looking at these numbers from here,  Indian option chain is buyer-specific.  It means that buyers find it more attractive because they get  cheap premiums.  They buy, even if those premiums are lost later.  That is a different thing, but it seems to be buyer-specific.  Writers are earning money, but buyers are more attracted to such  markets.  So, when we look at the call side, normally a common man buyer  thinks that  if I am looking at the call side, it means that the market has  to be bullish.  So, I should look at the call side if I am thinking of buying.  And the bearish one who is thinking of selling below, I should  look at the put side.  Then I will know that the market is bearish.  But how does the option chain work?  It is exactly the opposite of this.  If you are thinking of selling in the market, then you have to  pay attention to this side.  And if you are thinking of buying in the market, then you have  to pay attention to that side.  In the put side.  Because the writers of put will write, then it will go towards  the bullish market.  And when the call writers write, then the market will go downwards.  So, if we are thinking of buying, suppose I had a dream that  I have to buy in Nifty.  So, at least start looking at this side.  And if we are thinking of selling, then start looking at this  side.  Now, this is where the talks start.  There is a story, there is a story that how do I see this option  chain.  I specifically imagine this option chain.  I do an imagination here.  How do I do imagination?  If I am here.  Yes, absolutely. You use it.  So, if we look at this option chain, then I do an imagination  here.  What imagination do I do?  I do an imagination of an imaginary line.  That is my first concept, my theory is also that in this market.  Line means you are plotting a line on the chart.  No, I am plotting a line on this option chain.  You are plotting a line on this.  Yes, I am plotting a line on this.  Okay.  How will I plot that line?  I will imagine that.  I call it an imaginary line.  I will do imagination.  There will be a line here.  Now you also have to do this imagination.  Where do you have to do imagination of that line?  When people see options, they understand that most people relate  options to the future.  Right.  That it is related to the future.  But what I think is that the option and the future are two children  of the spot.  Right.  The future is generated from the spot and the option is generated  from the spot.  Right.  So, I relate the option to the spot.  So, when you look at the option chain of the National Stock Exchange,  then basically it relates to the future.  And I will teach you the concept of future specific out of the  money and in the money.  It is specific to the future.  It relates to the future prices.  But I relate it to the prices of the spot.  Now, if we talk about the market price of Nifty on the National  Stock Exchange.  See, here the market price of Nifty is written.  Right.  The market price of Nifty is 18,512.  Okay.  So, the first thing we have to think is that which two strike  prices are in between 512.  Every strike price has its own pair.  The pair of 100 will be with 150.  Okay.  The pair of 150 will be again with 200.  Okay.  By doing this, when we come, we will know that the pair of 500  is with 550.  And the line I am imagining is in between these two.  Okay.  Okay.  This is my imaginary line.  Okay.  Here I am imagining that there is a line.  Now, my option chain is divided into four parts.  If I write it as A, B, C and D.  It will be four quadrants.  Yes.  Okay.  It is divided into four parts.  Now, what is visible on the option chain of the National Stock  Exchange?  You can see A part dark.  You can see D part dark.  You can see B part white and C part white.  Sometimes it will happen that when there is a difference between  the future and the spot on the same option chain.  Suppose, the price of the future is the price of the spot.  Then only the future will be visible.  In such a case, it will look dark from here.  512 0:20:04,400 --> 0:20:02,000 Let's say the price is 551.  But still, I will imagine it according to the spot price.  That this is my price.  Now, it is divided into four parts.  Now, this is where the concept of in the money, out of the money  and at the money is derived.  What does in the money mean?  If I go to explain technically,  then technically, it is written on Google in many places.  And people see and understand.  But we understand it in random language.  What is in the money?  In the money means intrinsic values.  Intrinsic values means simple thing.  If we are going to buy a laptop,  the person who sold me this laptop,  If I bought this laptop for 50 rupees,  then he would not have got this for 50 rupees.  He would have got it for 45, 46, 49.  He would have got it for less than that.  Similarly, when a writer sells us this product,  then we have to see what is the cost of this to the writer.  So, the writer has to pay the cost of intrinsic value.  How is it?  In the call side, the market,  whichever strike price,  this is 512,  whichever strike price it has crossed,  that's why I saw the line of imagining,  it has crossed 500.  So, in the call side, all above 500 are in the money.  Before that, how much?  Before that, how much?  450, 400, 350, 300, all of these are in the money.  So, you will see this in the dark.  And in the put side,  the market,  which has not been touched yet,  or if we say, if we go from this side,  then the one who has crossed,  the market is falling down in the put side.  Now, if the market was of 19,000,  then it would have slowly fallen,  it has crossed 18,550.  Now, it has not gone to 500.  So, the one who has crossed in the put side,  the market, basically,  this is the part of our in the money.  So, this is what we see dark here.  Because whatever is the premium of the option,  tell you guys, there are two things in it.  Either, there are two things,  one is the time value and the other is the intrinsic value.  So, sir, I want to explain the concept to you.  If you are talking about 18,300 for example,  it is 253 and your market is running at 18,512.  So, if you do 18,512 in front of you,  I will show you,  the concept will be clear to you.  I am taking a second's time,  so that I can tell people.  Yes, absolutely.  The market is at 18,512,  minus I do 18,300.  So, I have the value of 212.  But the price here is 253.  If I do minus 253,  then 41 is extra.  This is the time value.  And what is other than this is the intrinsic value.  So, this premium of 41 rupees is expensive for now.  Expensive or the buyer who is buying is giving 41 rupees extra.  Let's explain it in plain language.  Brother, this is the commission of the writer.  It is a commission, you understand.  Now, suppose the writer's commission here is 41 rupees.  So, if we see at 350,  then you will get the same intrinsic value plus time value at  350.  You can call it time value or extrinsic value.  Actually, the fault is considered as theta,  but there are many things behind it.  The only bad name is theta.  Now, let's talk like this here, with 500.  To understand the audience easily,  straight calculation.  How much is 500 rupees above 500?  Above 12 rupees.  So, 12 rupees is yours.  And the remaining 90 rupees is of who?  Writer.  Means the writer is telling you openly here,  Brother, I am eligible to take 90 rupees here.  If you want to buy, buy.  If you don't want to buy, don't buy.  We need to understand it.  Now, I will tell you a very interesting story here.  The interesting story is that,  we will clean this.  And the interesting story is that,  this has become our imaginary line.  Okay, this has become our imaginary line.  Okay.  You must have heard it, maybe that story.  Still, I will tell you.  If you have heard, then tell me.  One, the story of two cats.  Two cats are there.  Both get a bread.  Okay.  And for that bread, both have a fight.  Why does the fight happen?  Because both do not have harmony with each other.  Both do not trust each other.  Now, in this fight, both reach a clever monkey.  The monkey says, I have a scale.  I will weigh the bread on this scale.  And I will give you exactly the same.  The cats are very happy.  Okay, fine.  The monkey says, but.  The cat says, what but?  What is my hard work?  So, the cat says, what will you take? Tell me.  The monkey says, I will not take anything.  Nothing.  When I go to weigh the bread,  then the piece of bread on either side,  suppose it is a little heavy,  even a gram is heavy,  I will eat that one gram of bread.  I will give you exactly the same.  The bread is yours.  The cat says, very good.  So, the monkey says, okay.  Now, when he weighs,  when he balances,  then intentionally,  the piece of bread on one side,  makes it extra heavy.  And as soon as it becomes extra heavy,  it becomes extra heavy like this.  Now, when the weight of the other side is light,  then the other heavy one,  eats that piece.  And by doing this, Thursday comes.  The bread is over.  3.30 pm comes.  And all the premiums become zero.  Right.  The bread is over.  So, now who are the two cats here?  One is a call buyer, one is a put buyer.  And the monkey is the seller.  The monkey is the writer.  The call buyer said,  that I, what do I say,  the writer said to the call buyer,  that if the market goes up,  you book the profit.  And when the market falls down,  you book the profit.  Now, basically what happened,  that neither the market took it specifically up,  nor took it down,  and at the end of the day,  end of the week,  the whole premium became zero.  Right.  So, in short,  this is the story of the writers.  Now, when we see the same story here,  we see the same story here.  Here, we don't have to see this part.  Hmm.  And we don't have to see this part in the put side.  Hmm.  Why not?  Because it is made up of two things.  As you just said.  One is intrinsic and the other is time value.  But there is no intrinsic value in this part.  All this is time value.  Means, the writer has the opportunity to buy all this money.  If you are buying for Rs. 75,  then the writer has the opportunity to earn Rs. 75 and take it.  Here, the writer has the opportunity to earn Rs. 71 and take  it.  Hmm.  Now, this is where my theory starts.  How does the market work in a specific period?  Means, if we want to see the market,  if we want to go from here,  here is my house and I want to go to my office.  So, to go to my office,  I will not look at the outside corner of the office.  What I will do is,  I will look at my gate from here.  If I go ahead from there,  then I will look at the way ahead.  Similarly, we see this.  What will we do first?  First of all,  now you tell me by looking at it.  Yes.  What will we do first?  We will first imagine this imaginary line.  We have imagined this.  Hmm.  Okay.  Now, we will see the premiums of Out of the Money here carefully.  Hmm.  And see the premiums of Out of the Money here carefully.  Which premium do you see more?  Near about, this is Rs. 75.  The call side is a little more.  Now, it is almost balanced.  It is balanced.  That Rs. 75 and Rs. 71 are equal.  This is where the game starts.  The premium on which you will see heavy at the immediate time,  the bread on that side is heavy.  Now, what will the monkey do?  It will make the bread on this side lighter.  Means, the writer will eat the premiums here.  Hmm.  It will keep eating for a specific time.  It will keep eating.  This premium will keep getting lighter.  And what will those premiums become?  They will become heavy.  They will become heavy.  A particular time will come.  There will be a place.  What will happen at that place?  These premiums have become lighter now.  And these have become heavy.  Where the writer assumes that this is the point, this is the  time,  that now I am considering this premium to be light and now I  am considering it heavy.  What will happen to that market from there?  It will reverse.  It will reverse.  So, the point that came,  the market came at that particular point from where it reversed,  the mathematics of that particular point,  I have derived that.  Hmm.  That the market will reverse from here because of these premiums  and their Greeks.  If people understand this, it will be very beneficial for them.  It will be very beneficial.  Because then we will get to know the specific market to the point,  which is called dot to dot.  That the market will reverse from here.  Right.  There are different theories.  We will try to understand those theories.  Because we are making a series,  so in the coming episodes,  many things will be seen by our viewers.  So, we are going to discuss all these things.  How are we doing this?  So, here you have left a suspense for people, I hope.  Now, what Sir said here is that there are specific points from  where the market reverses  and it can be calculated.  How you have to do it, you will get to learn in the next video.  So, we will give you a little bit of trouble.  See, this is a series.  So, there is no next video.  Apart from this, you will get videos on the other theories of  Sir.  So, you stay tuned.  You subscribe to this channel.  Click on the bell icon.  And if you have any questions, then ask in the comments.  We are definitely going to discuss those questions.  All your questions are in your mind.  Options related to trading, buying, selling, in fact, related  to strategies.  Please ask, do ask in the comments so that we can discuss them.  And I hope you are enjoying learning.  So, keep learning in this way and keep moving forward.  And we will meet you in the next video.  You can share this video so that by the time the next video comes,  many people will know that they can learn the secret of the option  chain.  And that too through YouTube.  So, we will see you in the next video. Till that time, you go  self-made.  And Jai Hind.  Until then, keep learning, keep smiling and keep enjoying life.

121,Not Misleading,"
So today you will be very excited because we told you in the 

last video that today you 

are going to learn chart of accuracy. Now, in this also, sir, 

1.0 and 2.0, there are 

two different theories. We will explain both. So sir, let's start 

with your chart of accuracy 

in which we do not need to see the chart. There is no need to 

see the chart in the theory 

of chart of accuracy. Basically, why did the chart of accuracy 

theory come into being? 

The reason behind the formation of the chart of accuracy theory 

was the movement of the 

chart of accuracy theory. It was a movement of open interest 

and volume. When I started 

tracking these movements, means continuously I kept watching 

specific movements for 3-4 

months, how it happens. What happens is, like we have eclipse, 

so scientists have very little 

time to study the eclipse. Why? Because it will come, then when 

it will come the second 

time, I do not know. And when it comes, it will come after a 

long time. Right. The same 

scenarios of chart of accuracy are there. One scenario may come, 

then it may take 3 

months. After 3 months, this scenario is repeating. So, to study 

it, that particular day is there. 

The day it has come and many times we will study it, then we 

will reach a theory that 

this is a particular theory. So, you can understand how much 

time it would have taken to make 9 

scenarios. In understanding 9 scenarios, the whole market is 

focused on this. It is not 

different from this. So, let's try to understand this. So, now 

when we try to understand the 

topic of chart of accuracy 1.0, then there are 9 different scenarios 

in itself that 

we have to learn here. What movement am I talking about here? 

First thing is this. I 

am talking about the movement of open interest and volume here. 

Let me remind the audience 

that what we talked about in the last episode that if volume 

and open interest are together 

and are traveling towards out of the money, then both will travel, 

then we will consider 

it as travel. This travel is visible to you with yellow colored 

arrows. And if we are 

traveling towards in the money, then if one also travels, then 

we will consider it as 

travel. Either it is strong, which is not traveling anywhere, 

or it is traveling, then 

it is marked with yellow color. So, we have to see this, we have 

to understand that basically 

where this travel is coming. Once we show the option chain. Yes, 

we understand it by 

showing in the option chain. Now we come to the option chain. 

We were talking that day 

how we were talking that this is our support and resistance and 

this resistance is trying 

to travel this way. So, because here it was only of volume, so 

volume is trying to travel. 

So, here you will see a yellow colored arrow. You will see its 

symbol like this. If 18,500 

is 32,000 and instead of 23,000, 24,000, 25,000, 26,000, whatever 

is happening, then 

it is moving. And how is it moving? It is moving in the direction 

of this arrow. So, 

now in the option chain, what is the top and bottom? It is very 

important for us to understand 

this. The smallest strike price in the option chain is bottom. 

This is bottom and in the 

option chain, this is top, which is the biggest strike price. 

Now if you look carefully, 

then where is this volume moving? It is moving towards the top. 

So, what do I call this? 

I call this weak towards top. Means this volume is weak towards 

the top. And if this movement 

was on this side instead of this side, then what would I say? 

Weak towards bottom. Means 

it is weak towards the bottom. When this volume, highest volume, 

shifts from here and goes 

to a strike price, then we call it weak towards top. And when 

this highest volume, whether 

it is call side or put side, shifts from here and tries to move 

towards a bottom strike 

price, then we call it weak towards bottom. Towards bottom. Yes. 

And I show this with 

the yellow color arrow. And when we come to this in our chart 

of 1.0, then you can see 

this with the yellow color arrow. What is visible here? You can 

see many tops and many 

bottoms. What are the movements? Now we try to understand this 

basically. What is this? 

Now the first scenario, scenario number 1. It has a total of 

9 scenarios. And remember, 

believe me, whether we talk about stocks, whether Nifty, Bank 

Nifty, or Fin Nifty, I have never 

seen the market outside these 9 scenarios. You have never seen 

in your life. That trade 

in the market. What will it say? You can see CEPE written in 

many places. Okay. That somewhere 

PE is written, somewhere CE is written. So now what we have to 

do according to what it 

says is to take a trade. On one side, I have written trading 

at EOS, which means trading 

on extension of support. Right. Support can be a little confusing 

here. Support is written 

up here and resistance is written down. This is according to 

the option chain. If you look 

at the call side, then resistance is made below and support is 

made above. So this is 

according to the option chain. So whether we have to take a trade 

on support or not, 

or whether we have to take a trade on resistance or not, this 

chart of accuracy will show you 

1.0. In its 9 scenarios. First scenario, scenario number 1. What 

does scenario number 

1 say? When support is strong, resistance is strong, means movement 

is not happening 

anywhere. Y and volume are not moving anywhere. In such scenarios, 

whenever the market comes 

below its support, you buy. There is no problem with the call 

option. The market will go up. 

And whenever the market comes above its resistance, you buy the 

put option. There is no problem. 

The market will fall. If you trade in cash, then buy in cash. 

Whether it is stock, whether 

it is nifty, whether it is bank nifty, whether it is fin nifty. 

Now let's come to this scenario 

number 1. The market is not going to break anywhere here. But 

generally, when such a 

scenario comes, then what generally happens in the day? In such 

scenarios, the market 

will remain till half day, 12.30, 1 pm and after that, slowly, 

slowly, slowly, it will 

move to some other side. Some other scenario. Yes, the market 

will come in some other scenario. 

So once, twice, you took a trade and there was a profit in it. 

Yes, you took a trade twice, 

three times. Like now, I am talking about last Friday. So last 

Friday, we took a trade 

five times. After that, the movement was shown that the upper 

side is happening. I will show 

you that too on the option chain, how it is happening on the 

upper side. Now let's come 

to scenario number 2. In scenario number 2, now support is strong. 

What I was talking 

about a while ago that support is strong many times, but still 

people think that this support 

will not break. So generally, what do they do? They buy the call 

option. You should not 

buy the call option. If the resistance is weak towards the bottom, 

now suppose that 

we come back to the option chain. Now suppose that the resistance 

is here in the market, 

where it is at 18,000, at 18,700, somewhere resistance is there. 

Now in such a case, and 

suppose support is at 18,500, this is support. When will this 

support break? It is not necessary 

that the support is weak. If this resistance is weak from 7000 

towards the bottom, suppose 

that the pressure starts to create here, then it will break this 

support. It will push 

it back and then you will see a new support after half a day. 

There is no doubt that it 

will not be seen. Now in the beginning, we do not see it. So 

what we do? We take a trade. 

So this is a prediction. This is a prediction of open interest 

and volume. A new volume 

will be created after half a day, after 1 o'clock, after 2 o'clock. 

There is no doubt 

that it will break. So what we have to do that day, we do not 

have to buy here. Because 

if we buy and then suddenly YI, then we will be trapped, we will 

be lost. What we will 

do better than this, whenever the market will be visible at its 

top, because 500 is our 

resistance, so whenever it is visible above 500, a new resistance 

is being created. So 

when it is visible going a little above 500, we will sell from 

there and if we sell, then 

what will we get from there? We will have to explain weak towards 

the bottom once. In 

the example of 18700, it will not be clear to people. You told 

me weak towards the bottom 

on the call side. Explain that once. We were from the port side. 

Explain this one once 

and then explain this one too. Now understand the meaning of 

weak towards the bottom. Like 

suppose resistance, this 13 lakh is not here. Suppose what is 

here, it is 53 lakh. Example 

is fine. 53 lakh. This is 53 lakh and here we are seeing 32 lakh. 

So if 32 lakh is visible, 

then it is not weak towards the bottom. But suppose it is 49 

as it increases from 32. 

Now what has happened to this resistance? The resistance that 

was 700 earlier, now it 

is being created at 500. The new resistance that is being created 

from the beginning, 

which side is it? Our bottom is here in the option chain, our 

top is here in the option 

chain. So where is the new one from the beginning? In the context 

of the previous one, the new 

one is towards the bottom. That is why we called it weak towards 

the bottom. This resistance 

is weak towards the bottom. Now let's talk about the put side. 

Now here you can see 

the volume of 27 lakhs. If this 18 lakh volume increases to 21, 

22, 23, then the support 

is weak on this side and weak on this side. So now suppose this 

market started falling 

down and it came to 500. So what will people think at 500? Because 

here the highest volume 

is there, so they will think that the market will reverse from 

here. But since it is weak, 

it will not reverse. In fact, where did that support go? 400. 

Means the market is now 

ready to fall down by 500 points. Now what will happen in such 

a case? In such a case, 

what will we consider this support? Weak towards bottom. This 

support is also weak towards 

its bottom. If this support, this support, here is the support 

of 27, 91,000. Here is 

the support of 21, 97,000. If a new volume was created here, 

suppose of 23 lakhs, which 

is in the money, then this support would have been weak towards 

the top. So these different 

scenarios, if you look here, you will understand what these scenarios 

are. Now where to buy 

a call, which day to buy a call, which day to buy a put, or how 

to convert yourself after 

half a day, we can see here. Now let's look at these scenarios. 

The first scenario, 

when both support and resistance are strong, then buy a call, 

buy a put, you will get 

trades from both sides. Buy a put above every resistance, buy 

a call below every support. 

If the support is extremely strong in itself and the resistance 

is weak towards the bottom, 

that means resistance is creating pressure towards the bottom, 

towards the support, in 

such a case, that support will break. So do not buy on such support. 

Whenever you get 

top, whenever the market is towards resistance, above resistance, 

sell it. Once it has come 

from above resistance, it has gone again, it is above the previous 

strike price of resistance, 

then also sell it. That means whenever you get top, sell it. 

Those who see price action 

or charts, in price action charts, they say ascending or descending, 

it is getting top 

now, so keep selling, the market will keep selling easily. Now 

suppose that the market 

is on its support and support is weak in itself. 

to shift higher. This is the rally day. 

This day, there will be a rally. And this day, there will be 

a bearish rally. Means, the market will break down. 

So, this day's rally will be small. In the comparison of what 

I will tell you later. 

This day, there will be a rally. This rally is of almost how 

many points? It is of almost 100 points. 

And this rally below is of almost 100 points. This rally will 
0:10:25,480 --> 0:10:03,556
strong. But the resistance is weak towards the top. Resistance 

be up to the point where it is weak towards 

top or weak towards bottom. It is a rally of almost 100 points. 

Means, the market goes ahead 

crossing the second strike price from one strike price. And if 

we come to this rally in the option 

chain, then this is the best part of it. Now, what I am telling 

you, he will see very carefully 

that how far the market will go up. Now, I will tell you. Suppose, 

the resistance you are seeing here 

is of 32,95,000. Suppose, it is weak towards the top up to 600. 

When it is only weak towards the top, 

I am not talking about shifting, it has not been the highest, 

till then the market will go above 550, 

will be below 600. It will reverse from there again and again. 

It will not go above it. 

When it is weak towards the top at 600 and shifted at 600, if 

shifting is done at 600, 

then it will go above it. In such a case, the market will go 

above 600 and reverse from there. 

Now, suppose you want to find out that a very big rally is going 

to come someday. How do we know that? 

What happens on this day? We can see the resistance in the market 

at 500. And this is weak towards 

the top, suppose it is at 800. Now, it is only weak, in such 

a case, the market has the ability to go 

above 750. And if it becomes the highest while going there, then 

the market will go above 800. 

If it does not happen, then the market has the ability to go 

up to 750. In the same way, in the case of going down, 

suppose there is support and it is weak towards the bottom. How 

far? As far as the bottom will be, 

one strike price will go to the market before that. In the case 

of weakness, and as soon as the shifting 

happens, the market will shift below it. Until the shifting is 

not done, it will never go. You pay attention 

to this. It is a very interesting thing. It will not go, it cannot 

go. It will start struggling there. 

And it will go only when it is the highest. After being the highest, 

the market goes up to that. 

Volume. Volume. Or whatever resistance, whatever support, we 

have read in the previous episodes. 

We will have to revise it again and again. Who is being talked 

about here? Okay, now let's come back. 

Let's see where big scenarios are made. And I will tell you that 

if you have not seen the previous episode, 

then you can go and see it on iOBitain. And if you feel that 

something is missing in this video, 

you are not getting clarity, everything is being taught with 

a lot of time. Watch it again and again 

and make notes. So that your concepts will be clear. I have told 

you, maybe once it has gone out of the head. 

Watch it a second time, watch it a third time, the concept will 

be clear. Look, when a scenario is 

researched, it takes a lot of time to research. So when it takes 

so much time to research, 

then you should give a lot of time to learn. Not once, not twice, 

not five times, not five times, 

not ten times, watch this video a hundred times. Watch it. Now 

let's go, we try to understand. 

Scenario number four. When the resistance is strong and the support 

is weak towards the bottom, 

the market will break down again. How far will it break? Where 

the next support is shifting. 

Its one strike price is up to the first. And if the whole shifting 

is done, then the market will continue to break there. 

That day we do not have to buy, we just have to buy. Do not think 

that if it breaks there, 

then I will go there and waste time there. How time is wasted, 

I will tell you. 

Like suppose, we come here again and see. Suppose that this support 

is weak towards the bottom. 

And here this support is weak towards the bottom. Where is the 

support weak towards the bottom? 

Suppose from here, it is weak towards the bottom. So now we do 

not have the mood to sell. 

I mean, we do not have the conviction that whether we sell or 

not, whether we sell or not. This happens many times. 

So what do we do in such cases? We think that okay, it is weak 

towards the bottom, 

then it will reach 400 or 350. If it falls below that, then I 

will buy from there. 

In this way, your time will be wasted. How will the time be wasted? 

Suppose the market reached there 

by dragging and dragging. And the time is 3 o'clock, 3.15 o'clock. 

What will you do now? 

You will not be able to do anything. You will be idle all day. 

It is better that you sell from the top. 

You will keep getting money. So always take care of this thing. 

Now let's talk about the next scenario. Our next scenario is 

scenario number 5. 

Here the support is strong, sorry, the resistance is strong and 

the support is weak towards the top. 

In such cases, the market is creating pressure upwards. We do 

not have to sell anywhere that day. 

That day we will buy from the bottom. And such scenarios also 

happen many times in the market. 

Such scenarios are very interesting and fun. Many times open 

interest creates such scenarios more 

rather than volume. Open interest creates such scenarios a lot 

instead of volume. 

Now comes the dangerous rally, which is called bloodbath and 

bullrun. 

Where the bull will run, the bull will run and there will be 

bloodbath. That is this day. 

Let's take Bank Nifty. Now let's try to understand the support 

resistance in Bank Nifty. 

The biggest open interest and the biggest volume that you can 

see in Bank Nifty, 

we can see on the left side at Rs. 43,000, Rs. 1,82,000 and on 

the right side we can see at Rs. 41,00,000 and Rs. 1,23,000. 

So what is the support? Support is Rs. 43,000 and resistance 

is also Rs. 43,000. 

Now suppose someday, there is no such scenario here, 

suppose the resistance is at Rs. 43,300. Suppose there is resistance 

at this place. 

And suppose the support is at Rs. 43,000. Now this resistance 

is weak towards the bottom at Rs. 43,000 

and this support is weak towards the bottom at Rs. 42,600. 

We have to explain this. Give some time to this. 

We have to tell people again how it will be weak towards the 

bottom. 

Try to understand how it will be weak towards the bottom. 

It will be weak towards the bottom like this. Suppose this volume 

is the highest here. 

Now we can see 37 lakhs. Forget this 37 lakhs. Suppose this is 

not 30 lakhs, it is 60 lakhs. 

I will write 60 here. This is 60 lakhs and this is 37 lakhs. 

If it is up to 37 lakhs, then it is fine. There is no such weakness 

towards the bottom. 

It is 40, 45, 46, 48, 49, 51. Now we will start believing that 

this resistance is creating pressure. 

At what strike price? At the strike price of Rs. 43,000. 

This means that the market that was going to stop at Rs. 43,300 

will stop at Rs. 43,000 if it is coming from below. 

What is this resistance? Make an arrow. Make an arrow from the 

highest to the second highest. 

You will know. If the direction of the arrow is this, then we 

will call it WTB, weak towards bottom. 

If the direction of the arrow is this, then it will be called 

WTT, weak towards top. 

Make an arrow. It is not difficult to understand WTB. 

It is a simple thing. You have to make an arrow from the highest 

to the second highest. 

This is the highest, this is the second highest. Make an arrow. 

Now tell me what is this? 

WTB. If the arrow is made downwards, it is WTB. If the arrow 

is made upwards, it is WTB. 

Here, see, the highest to the second highest. This is 41 lakhs, 

this is the second highest. 

Tell me what is made here? WTB. Remember that the bottom is here 

in the option chain and the top is here in the option chain. 

So, the direction in which the arrow will be made, that is the 

WTB. 

Now our scenario was that when the market falls, then both the 

arrows will be made upwards. 

Now suppose that where is our resistance? Our resistance is at 

43,300. 

Forget 20 lakhs. Suppose here it is 60 lakhs. And the support 

is at 43,000. This is 41 lakhs. 

Now this resistance, this 60 lakhs, suppose here it is 52 lakhs. 

Means what happened to this resistance? The highest to the second 

highest arrow was made and it became WTB. 

And suppose this support is weakened from 41 lakhs to 42,600. 

Suppose it is weakened here and what happened in the market here? 

Suppose the support is 32 lakhs. 

Now what happened to this support? It became WTB. This is the 

day of heavy fall. 

I tell you, in such cases, such cases happen many times when 

the market is standing at 43,000 and 300. 

And you can see that this is weak towards the bottom. 

Means it is seen that this market is at 43,000, 300 to 600. 

This is going to be a fall of 700 points and it is clearly visible. 

When it is to happen, it starts to be seen from the morning. 

Now this is the rally of 700. 

If you can catch it, then catch it. Leave it. 

This market will go down giving full bloodbath. 

And will go on going. And how far will it go? 

600, below 600, 500 and below 500, it will go to 400 something. 

Extension. 

It will go to the extension. It will be fully extended. 

And this is such a big fall and it is very easy to catch it on 

the option chain. 

If you take a little, you have to practice a little. Without 

practice, you will get a headache. 

If you want 700 points, then you have to do it. 

You should understand the option chain. 

Now let's talk about the next scenario. Which scenario is such 

that we do not understand or where we should not trade? 

That is scenario number 8 and 9. 

Same number, similarly, the scenario is heavily bullish. 

The day the rally is going to come, both the weeks stop towards 

that day. 

And the scenario is heavily bullish. 

I want to make a scenario of the market that was running on last 

Friday. 

I want to show the scenario of last Friday. 

How is the scenario of last Friday? 

Look at the scenario of last Friday. 

Let's open Nifty or Bank Nifty. Let's open any of the two. 

We will see the scenario. 

If we look at Nifty on last Friday, we could see support at 500 

and resistance at 500. 

What happened on this day? 

This resistance was slightly weak towards the top. 

And what happened to this support? 

This support remained strong here. 

So what happened in such a case? 

The market went to the last and became bullish. 

Look at its charts. It went to the last and became bullish. 

Look at the charts. 

how much this market will be bullish? Maximum bullish will be 

above 550. 

Above 550. Now the whole day is over. If the day continues, then 

this market will be above 550. 

It keeps going. It keeps going like this. Slowly. Similarly, 

if both, if support also 

becomes towards top, then this struggle does not happen. In such 

a case, what happens? 

It jumps. And if this register shifts to 600, then what happens? 

The market still jumps 

and goes above 600. So, there are many scenarios. Now, if we 

talk here, 

if we come back to our option chain, and here we come back to 

the chart of aggressive, 

so how many scenarios have we seen so far? We have seen 7 scenarios 

where we also 

found out when the market is going to be in a fixed zone. In 

the second scenario, 

we found out when it is going to be a little slight bearish. 

In the third, we found out 

when it is going to be slight bullish. In the fourth scenario, 

we found out when it 

is going to be extra bearish. In the fifth, we found out when 

it is going to be extra bullish. 

In the sixth, we found out that the bulls stayed down and in 

the seventh, we found out that 

the bulls stayed up. But the market is also such that sometimes 

not taking a trade is 

also a trading in itself. That scenario is scenario number 8 

and scenario number 9. 

Especially for option buyers. What happens at this time? When 

the resistance is found 

out that the weak is towards the top and the support is weak 

towards the bottom. Or 

the resistance is weak towards the bottom and the support is 

weak towards the top. Means 

both are opposite to each other. This is the time of the crowd 

of call and put writers 

when both are fighting each other. And whoever wins here will 

drive the market. Now, 

since both are fighting here, we never understand. We do not 

know in such scenarios 

that where the market will go. So, at such times, you should 

hold your trade for a while 

and wait that basically in which direction the market is going 

to travel. 

Then you should wait for something to happen from the remaining 

7 scenarios. Yes, it will 

happen. It will take a while. After that, someone or the other 

will win. It is not that 

both will always fight each other. If you see such a scenario 

many times in the day, 

then at the end of the day, after 3 pm, you will see when many 

times the writers of both 

call and put start fighting each other. Means at the last end 

of the day. So, there is 

no time for buyers. What should buyers do from the market at 

that time? They should 

stay outside. It does not happen on Thursdays that the market 

is clear on Thursdays that 

where the expiry is going to happen. Similarly, if we talk in 

the morning at 9.15 am, when 

data starts to be made in the morning, these scenarios are made 

at such times also. When 

build-ups are happening, then we have to wait. So, we wait till 

9.20, 9.25, 9.30 am. Let's 

see which direction the market is going. It is not necessary 

that the market started 

and suddenly trade, trade, trade, trade. It is not necessary. 

Wait comfortably. Wait 

for your time. Let the resistance of the market go up or let 

it fall below the support. 

And at the same time, you go and trade in the market. If you 

trade first or trade later, 

then what will happen to you in such a case? That you will be 

trapped, you will get stuck 

in the market, you will be emotionally trapped and you will be 

busy managing that position 

all day. You will just keep managing. You will hedge, you will 

average, you will do 

something or the other just to save that position. But if you 

do not spend yourself 

before the time comes, I mean, I say here, do not spend yourself, 

wait. Did not spend 

and traded at the right time, then there will be no need to manage 

that position. The market 

will come, the dot will come up, it came above the good resistance, 

it reversed from there, 

buy the put, it went below the support, it reversed from there, 

buy the call and keep 

trading and keep moving your trading forward in this way. Now 

you tell. 

So, according to me, people should see scenario 8 or 9 once on 

the option chain. 

Absolutely, let's show it on the option chain. That when they 

do not want to trade. 

Now we see this scenario, what will happen in this? Suppose that 

our 18600 is 23 lakhs 

instead of 18600, there is a volume of 60 lakhs. We have again 

agreed. This is the resistance. 

And our support is 1 CR instead of 18 lakhs. This is the support. 

This is the resistance, 

this is the support. Now we have to say that we have seen 7 scenarios 

in the chart of 

the market. We know the scenario where what is going to happen. 

Now this writer is thinking 

that the market is bearish. So, the market is bearish, so what 

did he start doing? He 

started writing this one. 102. Means, because of this writing, 

volume started creating 

here and here y started creating. So, this resistance weak towards 

bottom. Means, it 

became weak towards the bottom. And what does this put writer 

think? That the market 

is bullish today. So, what did he start? He started writing this. 

What happened because 

of this writing? Here, volume started creating and y started 

creating. Now what happened? 

Resistance weak towards bottom, support weak towards top. Today, 

the writer is not able 

to understand where the market is. So, we buyers do not have 

to know. It can be very 

specific range bound. The market can be range bound or if at 

any time of the day, suppose 

the call side writer is very heavily bullish, then he will run 

away and we will get stuck 

in our trend. So, what happened to take that trade? It became 

50-50. Even if you buy a 

call, there is a target. Even if you buy a put, there is a target. 

So, we can get stuck, 

can get confused. So, it is better not to take trade, wait. You 

guys fight among yourselves. 

Tell us who will win, then we will take trade. It is simple. 

So, let them fight first. 

This is our scenario number 8. Means, when the support resistance 

is of each other. 

This can be another scenario. What will happen in such a scenario? 

Suppose, where is the 

support? This is the resistance at 500, this is 32 lakhs and 

this is the support at 500. 

This buyer feels like this, this writer feels like this, call 

side, that no, this market 

will not stop at 500, it will go somewhere at 600. So, it starts 

a new writing position 

here, due to which the resistance will stop towards the bottom. 

Means, the writer feels 

like this, the bullish market of the call side and the writer 

of the put side feels 

like this, this market will not stop here, he started writing 

for this, that market 

will stop here. So, it is also towards the bottom. So, the writer 

of the call side is 

thinking that the market is bullish, the writer of the put side 

is thinking that it is bearish. 

Now, they both do not understand that in which direction the 

market is. So, when they do 

not understand, then that market can move anywhere. Whatever 

will fall, it will move there. 

It is possible that the buyer will be specific on that day. How 

will the buyer be specific? 

Suppose, a lot of buyers come and start buying here and make 

this volume very heavy. 

Buying, buying, selling, buying, selling means taking a lot of 

trades. Made it very heavy. 

In such a case, due to these buyers, this market will fall and 

go up to 400. Why? Because 

this resistance will become strong after a while and this support 

will remain weak and 

the market will move downwards. So, these scenarios, these particular 

scenarios are 

how they make the whole market go up and down. It is better than 

that we are in such a volatile 

market or in such an unpredictable market, instead of trading, 

we follow the chart of 

accuracy and the chart of accuracy is 1.0 whatever it says. Put 

its screen on your wall. 

Whatever you do trading, paste it in front of your trading desk. 

Whatever it says, we 

have to do that, otherwise we do not have to do anything. If 

you do not get the trade, 

then sit quietly. If you trade according to this, then it will 

never go wrong and the 

market will run according to this. Right. So, I hope you have 

understood 9 scenarios. 

But here is another surprise for you. The surprise is that this 

was the chart of accuracy 

1.0. So, my friend, the picture is still left. The picture is 

still there. The rest is that 

if we talk specifically to the buyer, then the market runs well 

in these scenarios and 

runs very well. Sometimes the market becomes consolidated. I 

mean, now we are talking about 

all this move, whenever the movement is coming. Now the market 

has become consolidated in 

this scenario. It is stuck, the market has stopped. So, what 

should we do in such a case? 

How to get out of this case? For that, my next theory is the 

chart of accuracy 2.0. 

We will see that without seeing the chart. So, do you want to 

learn? If you want to learn, 

then do tell by commenting. We will try the next video to bring 

it on it. So, I think 

that's enough for this video for today. You practice it. Watch 

this video many times. 

You can like this video to show your love. Subscribe to it. Click 

on the bell icon if 

you don't want to miss the next video. Because the information 

you are getting, I think, 

is available anywhere on YouTube. No, no, I have not seen it 

yet and I have interacted 

with almost more than 50,000 traders. So, what I get is that 

people have been trading 

for 30-35 years. They say that the thing you have made, we could 

never have thought of 

it. It can be so systematic. So, if people are getting to learn 

in such a systematic way, 

in fact, they are also getting to learn for free, then I think 

you should write thank 

you in the comments. You should write for sir. So, do comment. 

It will tell how much 

you love, how much you are watching carefully and finally, you 

can ask some questions in 

the comments. We will see you in the next video. Sir's channel 

link will be found in the description 

and till the time you self-made and Jai Hind. Keep learning like 

this, keep smiling and 

keep enjoying life.

"
122,Not Misleading,"
So welcome to the final video of this series. We told you that 

today you will learn chart 

of accuracy 2.0 in this video. So now if we are talking about 

a level above, then you 

can see behind that this is something that is not understood 

at once. So now what is 

this, to teach you in detail, sir is ready. So sir here we go. 

Absolutely, welcome everyone 

again and welcome and today we are going to talk about chart 

of accuracy 2.0. For the 

first time, we have done so many episodes, spent so much time, 

for the first time we 

are talking about something that looks like a chart graph, some 

items, some items have 

come that look like a graph chart. Till now we were playing with 

numbers only. So let's 

try to understand what is basically chart of accuracy 2.0. Chart 

of accuracy 2.0 is 

basically the numbers of open interest, how open interest moves 

specifically. Many times 

we see in the market that the market is range bound at one place 

or it gets stuck around 

a particular strike price, stops, cannot get out of it. Or many 

times free fall or 

bull run is found in the market. How will we have its prediction 

on the option chain, 

we will know from this to see. Now before seeing this, let's 

see the option chain again 

that in the option chain, I am basically talking about the numbers. 

Till now what we were talking 

about was volume and open interest. Our audience must be thinking 

that there is no talk about 

open interest change, how does open interest change work and 

when does it work. Basically 

silently we have covered that open interest change. How did we 

cover it? When I was talking 

about movements, if there is a move in open interest, then automatically 

open interest 

change will increase or decrease, something will happen. So now 

we are going to talk about 

open interest change in chart of accuracy 2.0, how it works. 

Suppose this is 59000 

open interest change, you can see here. What does this change 

in Y mean? The open interest 

that was there yesterday, here in yesterday's date, 59148 is 

more than that today. Here 

in minus means, the open interest that was here yesterday, what 

is 281 less than that 

today. This is open interest change. Means the change that comes 

in both of them, we 

see it together. Whether you see this while changing, whether 

you see this, the thing 

is the same, it is not a different thing. Specifically, here 

the intraday is seen that 

how much extra is there today, new add-ons have been made or 

new people have come out, 

so it seems easier to see the change in Y. Now let's talk about 

understanding basically 

that how will we recognize this. See there will be 3-4 things. 

What will happen? Suppose 

if you catch a particular OI, 1,35,000, what can happen by seeing 

it? Either it remains 

completely stable, means it does not change, when slowly slowly 

1,35,000, 382, 832, where 

it reached? It reached 1,36,000. Then again 1,34,000 came, then 

138 went, then again 

135 came. So what is this number doing? It is increasing, decreasing, 

increasing, decreasing, 

but it is stable. So if we imagine its graph in our mind, think 

that it is making a graph, 

think that it is making a chart, then what kind of chart will 

be made? This will be a 

stable chart, the line will go straight like this. If we do imagination, 

then the line 

will go straight. If this number all of a sudden from 1,35,000, 

if it is going around 

135, then if this number is seen from 135 to 136, 137, 138, 140, 

150, 160, then imagine 

this graph, how will it be? Then this graph, then this graph 

will increase like this. And 

if this number goes from 135 to 125, 115, 1,00,000, then what 

does it mean? It will 

decrease. This case, in which I make an arrow, this case will 

only be seen in open interest, 

not in volume. Volume always increases. Now you imagine that 

there are total three directions. 

This open interest has the momentum to run in three directions. 

Either it runs stable, 

runs straight, or it starts increasing, or it starts decreasing. 

Now what happened after 

the market came? It got stuck, stuck, stopped. Now what we have 

to see is which two strike 

prices are in the middle of the imaginary line. Now what we have 

to take care of from 

here? Which strike price is closer to the market? For example, 

512 market is running. 

If the market is running at 512, then 512 is closer to 500 in 

comparison to 550. In 

comparison to 550, it is closer to 500. If it was 525, then it 

is in the middle. And 

if it was 527, 2830, then it is closer to 550. So we have to 

take care of who is closer 

to the market. We will pay attention to the open interest of 

both the call side and put 

side. Now suppose that the market is closer to 500. On Friday, 

the market was closer to 

500. Now look at the open interest of this on the call side and 

its open interest on 

the put side. Look at the Y change. Both are the same. Look at 

these two. Now their 9 

scenarios can be created. Total 9 scenarios can be created. After 

9, the 10th will not 

be created. Total 9 will be created. And these 9 scenarios are 

called the theory of chart 

of accuracy 2.0. Now let's try to understand which are those 

9 scenarios that we have to 

see here. These 9 scenarios are 9 different scenarios. You can 

see 9 designs. These are 

9 different scenarios. So look at these 9 scenarios. The first 

design, I say directly 

in the picture, see the picture and according to the picture. 

In the first design, you 

can see that it is written here, reversal at resistance. Reversal 

on resistance. And 

on the other side, it is written, reversal at support. What resistance 

support are we 

talking about? We are not talking about the resistance support 

of the market. We are 

talking about that particular strike price that the market will 

move forward by breaking 

that strike price or not. Or the market will go back by breaking 

that strike price or 

not. Now in the scenario of chart of accuracy 1.0, suppose you 

have imagined that this 

market is bearish and it is going to break from 18,500 to 18,300. 

But the market is stuck 

at 500. It is not falling down. It is not falling down. It is 

consolidated. When will 

it fall? When will any scenario come from these scenarios? Let's 

understand. In the 

first scenario, is reversal possible or not? This means that 

this is a scenario of market 

consolidation. Scenario of consolidation means that if it goes 

above the strike price, 

it will be reversed. If it goes down, it will be reversed. How? 

When the call side's 

open interest is shown here in green color and the put side's 

open interest is shown 

here in red color. So when the open interest of the call side 

is also stable, it means 

that it is neither increasing nor decreasing. And the open interest 

of the put side is also 

stable, it is neither increasing nor decreasing. In such a case, 

the market will be reversed 

from both sides. It means that it will continue to run consolidated. 

It will not break down 

or break out. It will keep rotating around the strike price. 

This is your scenario number 

1. I hope you understood this. Now let's come to scenario number 

2. Scenario number 

2 directly says that the put side is stable. It means that the 

open interest of the put 

side is neither increasing nor decreasing. The open interest 

of the put side is stable. 

But the open interest of the call side is written as heavily 

increasing. It is increasing. 

It is increasing in a forcible way. It means that the call is 

being written. In such a 

case, the market will break its support. It means that it will 

break below the strike 

price. And as soon as you get the chance, sell it. Sell it. Sell 

it. And if you are 

writing, then in the case of writing, because the market is going 

to fall, then you write 

the call with these writers. The one who is increasing, keep 

writing it. Keep writing 

it. As long as it is increasing, you keep writing. This is scenario 

number 2, where 

there is a breakdown in the market. The market breaks down. And 

if your desired direction 

is matching with 1.0, then you sell it immediately and you will 

get money. Scenario number 3, 

where the call side is increasing heavily and the put side is 

decreasing heavily. The 

call side is increasing heavily and the put side is decreasing 

heavily. Here, the put 

side was still stable. Here, the writers of put also ran away 

from there. Now, this is 

a sign of a heavy fall that a very big fall is going to come 

in the market. I tell you 

my experience. This scenario is made many times at the top of 

the market. And there 

the market is seen with so much clarity. With so much clarity 

that the market is going 

to break down very well. There is such a desire that means, put 

as much money as you can 

in this market because it is going to give a good return. And 

in such cases, a great 

fall also comes. We should always keep our risk in mind. It is 

not that we have put all 

the money by selling the house. We should put according to our 

risk. Scenario number 

4, in these scenarios, you will see that the call side is stable. 

There we had kept the 

put side stable and in the third, we had shown the put side in 

the movie. Here, the call 

side is stable and the put side is heavily increasing. Means 

the open interest of the 

put side, that is, the strike price is moving up. It is increasing, 

increasing, increasing. 

In such cases, the call side will break out. There will be buying 

from the bottom in the 

market. You have to buy. The market will go above the strike 

price. It will break the 

strike price. It will jump to the next strike price. Then we 

will start seeing the same 

thing in the next strike price. Next case, scenario number 5. 

In scenario number 5, 

the put side is stable. The call side is heavily decreasing. 

Now the call writers are running. 

In such cases, the market will slowly slowly jump up and will 

not fall down. Because the 

put side is stable, the call side is heavily decreasing. The 

call writers are decreasing, 

decreasing. They must be shifting ahead. That scenario would 

have become weak towards the 

top and the market is trying to move towards the top. In this 

case, we will start buying 

from the bottom. We will start buying. But whenever the chart 

of accuracy is 2.0, we 

will not give priority to the chart of accuracy above 1.0. Remember 

this. We will take the 

direction chart of accuracy from 1.0. If we are stuck somewhere 

in the trade, then we will 

buy the 2.0 chart. 

keep seeing this all day. 

Then they forget 1.0. We don't have to do this by mistake. Scenario 

number 6. Here, 

the open interest of put side is increasing heavily and the call 

side is decreasing heavily. 

This is a very good scenario of bullish market. The market is 
0:10:19,200 --> 0:10:03,900
scenario. I hear some people, they see 2.0 once a day, so they 

going to fly. Just like it was 

going to be bearish here, it is the opposite scenario where the 

market is going to be specific 

bullish. You start buying from every bottom and keep buying. 

Until this open interest 

is increasing and until the market is in its trap, until it does 

not go out of the strike 

price zone to the next strike price, you are buying it. Let the 

market go to the next strike 

price zone. Then it will reach the next strike price zone, then 

start seeing its open interest. 

Many times you will see that the open interest of put side is 

increasing continuously 

till the next three strike prices. And in such cases, what will 

happen? The market will 

keep going up. Now let's come to scenario number 7. In scenario 

number 7, the open 

interest of put side is decreasing heavily and the open interest 

of call side is unstable. 

In such cases, you can sell the market from the top. The market 

will fall down. And what 

we will do at the bottom? This will break down at the bottom. 

So, we will not buy. 

Let's sell from the top. The market will keep falling down. There 

will be no long fall 

because it is stable and it is not putting a lot of pressure 

on the call side. You will 

see this in the daily morning. Morning means when build-ups are 

happening. Early morning 

call side is also increasing heavily, put side is also increasing 

heavily. Both are increasing. 

What will happen to the market? It will keep moving from one 

particular point to the other 

side. This is called a morning race. And wherever it stops on 

one side, the market will go to 

the other side. So, those who have to track the market in the 

morning, those who are 

waiting for the call side to stop, those who are waiting, suppose 

the put side stops, 

then start buying put immediately because the market will break. 

And if the call side 

stops, then start buying call. The market will fly. And what 

is the most dangerous scenario? 

This is the one. In the evening, except on Thursday, Thursday 

also comes. In the evening, 

after 3.15, after 3.10, it will come. When both the call side 

and put side are open. 

When the intraday writers exit, then the upper traders of both 

start falling heavily. 

This market is not for buyers. Buyers should stay away from such 

markets because during 

this time, you will not be able to predict the market because 

to predict, your eyes should 

be more open. You will need a lot of practice. How will it be 

predicted? I will tell you. 

Then we have to see which is decreasing less and which is decreasing 

more. Because intraday 

writers are leaving, positional writers are there. Then your 

eyes will be completely open 

and it will take you years to become that. If you have started 

watching Option Chain for 

the first time, then it will take years to reach there. You will 

have to work a lot. You 

will have to see a lot of specific things. So this is the chart 

of Igressive 2.0 in Option 

Chain and this 2.0 will make you capable of knowing when the 

market is going to jump 

after the range bound at any place. You will know this move here 

before that movement comes. 

And as soon as you know this move, because it is an option buyer, 

it is a game of Kabaddi, 

you have to go to touch in Kabaddi and I said that I will tell 

you at the end. I said in 

the second episode that I will tell you at the end that when 

we will know that the move 

is coming, then the chart of Igressive 2.0 will tell you that 

the move is coming. When 

this happens, start trading. Now the move is coming, you take 

the trade. So I think 

the arrows in Sir's Tarakash have given you that much and you 

will keep them carefully. 

So the chart of Igressive 2.0, Sir told you that the screenshot 

of 1.0, keep it carefully 

and first see it, then see 2.0. You have understood 9 scenarios 

here in 2.0 and 9 scenarios were 

told in 1.0. So a total of 18 scenarios have been explained to 

you. A lot has gone into 

your mind. If you have not practiced, you will forget everything. 

If you have not made 

notes, you will forget everything. So let the subconscious mind 

go. Make sure you make 

notes and finally how did you like this series because it was 

the final video of this series. 

You must definitely give feedback in the comments about what 

you liked the most in this whole 

series and you have to like it and share this whole playlist 

with as many people as possible 

because you can see how much effort Sir has made for this series. 

Yes, standing up has 

taken a lot of time. Standing up has taken a lot of time and 

specifically coming by flight, 

taking out time, giving knowledge for free, you understand what 

is the purpose. The purpose 

is to minimize your loss and maximize your profits. So don't 

just keep this knowledge 

to yourself. Share it and in fact when you share the playlist, 

you tell the person in 

front of you that what will he learn in this playlist. You understand 

that you are getting 

knowledge of lakhs of rupees for free. People can get it for 

free, so spread it to more 

and more people. If you have any questions, you can ask in the 

comments. I will share 

it with you. Again, we will try to take time again so that you 

people get maximum clarity 

and with this we will end up this playlist here now, but I hope 

you will keep learning 

and moving forward. If you want to see Sir's channel and subscribe, 

then you will get the 

link in the description. So we will see you in the next video. 

Till the time you go self-made 

and Jai Hind. So we have learned a lot about the option chain 

in this series. Remember 

one thing, the option chain is not for one day. You have to practice 

it continuously. 

So I am requesting you on behalf of Sir that don't watch this 

video once. Watch this video 

as many times as you want and you will not find this video new 

every time. Because every 

time when you watch, you will see the market of the next day 

and match these scenarios 

with it. And when you match it with it, then you will see that 

today this scenario was 

not there. And when it will connect, then slowly your trading 

will automatically improve. 

So I request all of you that the market is technical. Don't trade 

on the trust of anyone 

in the market. Whatever you have to build trust on yourself and 

trust yourself. Never 

come under any trap. Never come under anyone's specific talks 

that we will give you so much 

return. We will do this and that. If someone tells you that you 

will get 100% profit, 

it is sure shot, then nothing like that happens. You have to 

be careful and be careful. You 

have to work hard, you have to work hard and only then you can 

move forward in the market. 

Okay, this happens many times. People get a call on WhatsApp 

that we will give you tips 

and Sir, your results will come with 100% accuracy. So, someone 

came to my office, he 

said one thing, where are you working? He said, no, this is our 

job. He said, your 

job is very good, but you must be earning 20-25 thousand. He 

said, if you have so much 

trust in your tips, then you can put it. You will earn 25 lakhs 

from 25 thousand. If you 

have so much trust in your tips, then you can put it. How are 

such people? I count such 

people in that count, who try to fraud us on the phone call or 

through any app. And 

their category, this is not a stock market tipper, paper, or 

any advisor or any technical 

charts reader. These are the people in their category who are 

simply trying that someone 

will get trapped, who will be greedy, and as soon as we get greedy, 

we get trapped. 

So, my direct request is that, and the trap is also those people 

who are not ready to 

learn. Yes, ready. Leave all this to me, tell me directly, buy 

call or put, and I am done. 

That is such that they want that I am sleeping, you take my money, 

take my account details 

and trade my account. And then they take the money. They say, 

give it to me. So, you 

are safe from such people. This is what I feel like. Because 

this is happening a lot in 

the market. If something like this has happened to you, then 

you can tell your experience 

in the comments. And we are working so hard, we are doing it 

to save you from this. It 

is not that we are working so hard, standing for so long, shooting, 

doing everything, 

coming from so far, giving time to sir for so long. Why are we 

doing all these things? 

So that a common man, the common man, if he is not making a profit 

in the market, then 

at least his hard-earned money, his hard-earned money in the 

market, should not be given to 

such a man who is not worthy of any man. So, with these things, 

that's all from my side 

in this series. Keep learning like this, keep smiling and keep 

enjoying life. And if you 

get a chance, you will meet again, you will meet many times and 

you will keep meeting. 

100% So see you in the next video. Till the time, you go self-made 

and Jai Hind.


"
123,Not Misleading,"[Music]

so welcome back it's robert kiyosaki

with my dear friend's daughter here

alexa and we're talking about

millennials and money and we've gone

through some lessons i don't know how

many anymore

but um let's continue on with another

lesson here

and so you were talking about your you

know assets and liabilities right

yeah and when you had rich dad poor dad

i said your house is not an

asset what did you think well i think

that's a conception that many people

believe

but as you demonstrated at the last

seminar that we went to in argentina

it my mom had her properties and she

converted them into assets

correct i think it just depends on what

you do with it and it would be great if

you could show us how to turn your house

into an asset

it's a very it's really fundamental so i

could go back i probably covered it

earlier

but

it's a crucial question

and this is what financial education and

financial literacy really is

again it starts with a financial

statement and i would say

probably 95 percent of all college

graduates don't know what a financial

statement is

you took an accounting course right yeah

i did and i did parts of this

but i said young people like you there's

six basic words

to financial literacy and financial

education

and the six words again are

income expense

asset

liability see i don't really care about

my fico score

a fico score just basically registers

are you trustworthy with borrowing money

but a bank will never accept i borrow in

the hundreds

of millions of dollars a fico store that

could

get me there okay and so it's kind of a

ruse i mean i don't

it's important but not for me so these

are the four words income expense asset

liability

and the last two words are the words

cash

flow and that's why the game is called

cash flow

and the secret to being rich is not a

college education

but can you control cash flow

and this is what cash flowing looks like

so this here i need this

income says asset liability again this

is you get a job and this was my poor

dad go to school get a job get your phd

and so this here is cash flow so the

income comes in

and it goes out this way first line of

expense is tax

so this is a poor person's cash flow

pattern

it's not how much money you make

most people you know they i don't care

if you have a phd or no school at all

but they can't control the cash flowing

out through their expenses

and so that's why people like suzy orman

say cut up your credit cards live below

your means

because you're a spendaholic so that's a

poor person

this is a middle-class person's cash

flow pattern

and this is where the house comes in

they

first thing you know most kids do when

they get

pay raise or that they buy themselves

a bigger house oh my house is an asset

now who tells you that your real estate

agent of course

yeah right because they they want to

give you this false sense of security

while you're getting screwed

exactly yeah but when you look at what

happens with a house a personal

i mean a personal resident something i

live in the money comes in it goes out

and this is middle class but it also

goes out through a mortgage

mortgage payments oh but i don't have a

mortgage you still have

taxes you still you know hawaii just

raised the property taxes on me which is

probably i'm going to sell i'm going to

get out of hawaii

but you have taxes and you have upkeep

so money is always flowing out

so that's why your house is not an asset

it's because it's taking money from your

pocket

so very simply said assets

put money in my pocket liabilities take

money from my pocket

and then this here is so i'm not saying

don't buy a house

but here is a house

and i started when i was

25 bought my first house

it was an apartment it was an investment

property

i didn't live in it i rented it out and

it put money in my pocket

so very simple the definition of asset

and liability

is not the house of this it's cash flow

where is the cash flowing

so as a young person and to all

millennials or if you're old

financial intelligence is the ability

to control cash flow

and that's what they don't teach you at

school they tell you to go to school get

a job

first thing is tax

you know you'll pay most of your money

will go out through taxes

in your lifetime and then they tell you

to buy a house

and a car a car is an asset no the car's

a liability got insurance gas

upkeep and all this now if you buy a

a taxi car it could be an asset it's

cash flow

and that's very simply it so this is a

poor person

money goes out there's a lot we just

interviewed some national football

league players who make millions of

dollars in their 20s

and most of them are broke in two years

because they can't control

cash flow intelligence iq

is can you control cash flow not your

college degree

college degrees are important but

they're not going to teach you this so

the cash flow game

trains you over and over and over and

over again to get your money in here to

get cash flow

this way so i started with this

it cost me eighteen thousand 000

i paid for the credit card and i put 25

in my pocket

okay it's an infinite return because the

cash flow paid for the mortgage it paid

the expenses pays the operating cost and

i still made 25 dollars

kim's first deal was the same shares was

an 18 000. it was fifty thousand

forty five thousand and they put twenty

five dollars in a pocket

but kim now owns six thousand five

hundred

rental properties and she pays no tax

because the income comes from here

if you have a job you pay tax but income

the rich get richer

because when you have asset income

taxes are less you can get it down to

zero if you want but that's financial

intelligence but can you can control

cash flow

okay so say it again asks us what assets

put money

into your pocket liabilities take money

out of your pocket

and so as a young person just focus on

that so when you're buying a new house

you got to say

is this going to take money or put money

you buy an apartment house

is it going to take money or put money

that's it it's cash flow

66 most important words for

financial intelligence and iq is income

expense

asset liability but it's really cash

flow now if i could bring up a more

horrible subject

is do you think people can be assets or

liabilities

i think they could be both to be honest

so for most young people they

fall in love they get married they have

kids it's a child and asset a liability

a child is definitely a liability i'm

not saying don't have kids

but you got to think the kid is

expensive

and they don't get cheaper they get more

expensive every year

you know then they go to college and

then it gets even more expensive

so a human being and that sounds

horrible to all the socialists and

communists out there

but the fact is kids cost money but as

an old guy i want you to think about

this

as i get older

as people get older family members

become liabilities

so i have a friend whose mother

thank god she had long term i don't know

what they call it but they just

cancelled it on her

she can go to a old age home

and i think the price is 18 000 a month

most so that as a young person as your

parents get older the question is can i

afford

to spend thousand dollars a month on my

mom or my dad's

long-term health care yes or no

no not right now no so and this is going

to happen to my generation

many people don't realize but their

brothers or sisters or sisters kids and

all this become liabilities for them

so as a person is fairly well off

i'm and kim and my friends

are thinking about

two-legged liabilities so i know today

that if my sisters become ill

i'm the one with the money and it's my

responsibility to pay for them

same as my brothers and their kids so

these are things that people don't think

about a lot of times

is what happens not only as they grow up

but what happens as they age

statistics show the average person like

my generation

let's have a million dollars eighty

percent of that million dollars will be

gone

the last two years of life because

medical expenses go through the roof

and today insurance companies are

canceling i forget the name of it

but my friend's mother it was just

cancelled so he doesn't have 18 000 a

month

so he had to bring his mother into his

house and you know

create another room and all this is well

i love her what she does

but she's a big liability and all he had

was savings so the savings are being

depleted going out this way

okay so but your question about houses

and people but people are house assets

and liabilities

for most people with our favorite

subject

a 401k is an asset a liability from what

i've learned from you it's definitely a

liability

or an irra or a pension because it's

always going out this way

there's no guarantee it'll be there so

this is the basic of financial

intelligence financial literacy

stuff like this another thing about

people

is you have a bad advisor like a bad

financial planner or a crook or a

business partner as a crook

a wife that's a crook and all that there

could be human liabilities

i have two friends right now who just

joined a million dollar club

they married beautiful women

got divorced and the women is now

costing

a million dollars a year in alimony so

their beautiful wife and the child

support it's a million dollars going

and she's only 40 years old so she has a

whole pile of boyfriends

but it's costing him a million dollars a

year for her boyfriend's i said i want

to be her boyfriend

not really you know that makes sense to

you

yeah it makes sense financial iq is can

you

control cash flow iq means

how big a problem can you solve so if

like my friend whose

mother is now costing him 18 000 a month

well thank god he has about a hundred

thousand in savings

but in one year it's gone yeah that's

not

high iq but with for myself

eighteen thousand dollars a month i can

go make that much cash flow pretty

easily

yeah okay so when you're like in your

twenties per second well how am i going

to make let's say

by the time you have probably a hundred

thousand a month to take care of my

parents

because like it or not it's cash flow

and they become liabilities and it's the

problem is getting worse

i won't because the bond markets are not

providing income

so many insurance companies have to

renege on their promises to provide the

cash flow to take care of our loved ones

the same as medical and so that's why

when people say i'm going to go out on

my own and do all these things

they're kind of doing what they love

which is good but they've really got to

think about

how many liabilities do they have it's

not just your rent

you know it's your family and so for me

and for kim we have family members

but they're liabilities so that's why we

stay over here

hopefully nothing will go wrong but if

one of my sisters got ill and she needs

a hundred thousand a month at least i

can provide it

yeah otherwise they go they go in

indigent whatever they call it okay yeah

and the comments or questions

no thank you for sharing so much about

this content and all this information

that's going to be super valuable for

all my friends and all the millennials

out there just like me

i said i have two friends from now on

the million dollar a year club it

doesn't mean they're making a million

dollars is their wives

are taking a million dollars a year out

of their pocket and their kids and all

this

and i go you should have thought about

that 20 years ago but you don't because

you're in love and you're going to have

kids and

you're going to make it together but

your parents are

great role models so once again the six

words you have to know and be masters of

income expense asset liability cash

flow you can control cash flow that's

financial intelligence financial iq

and financial literacy okay okay thank

you

124,Not Misleading,"How you can earn a regular income from your investment, you will

know in this video

[music]

Friends, I am often asked the question

that what we are investing is for

long term when we are

old but  If we

want a regular income from her investment today

then how to think about that not only very good

question you start with d

in this video I will tell you five such ways

through which you

can generate a regular income through your investment in this

I  I will not give any raycommendation anywhere,

I will name many players,

no player has

given any money to make this video, this is

my organic suggestion, and more

important

on you is my personal

punch.  First of all, it

is not mine to be aware of Fixed Deposit,

I have often talked about Fixed Deposit,

today I will again tell you

which field this Fixed Deposit

is, in Fixed Deposit, you give your money

to a bank, that bank you  But laughs

but not in front of you and then

gives you an interest of four to six percent per annum

and nine date is regular in less so if you put ₹ 1

lakh then every year you will get 4 to 6% means

4 to 6000 rupees end date  This vile

keeping your principal which is ₹ 1 lakh

only people think is a very

good regular income

but probably not for you especially if

you are in your 20's or 30's why because

it is 4 to 6%  It is not even able to beat the inflation

means every year the

thing of ₹ 100 is increasing with the inflation which is poor 6%, then

next year the same thing will be worth 106

rupees, you will earn 4 to 6 percent

on it 30  Even if you pay % tax,

your ₹ 100 would have increased to only 104 103. So the

value of your money has

actually been created, so it is very important that

when you think about regular income,



focus on inflation adjusted returns.  Returns that

you will get regularly that you

earn more than inflation, adabise that is the

benefit of regular income, what

else

many people say that if

you invest in activities, you

can get regular income through it

but in equity market or stock

market  I have a problem that it keeps on

going high and low there is volatility build

in the market so there is a systematic

withdrawal plan like a systematic

investment plan SIP

is similar to S and P about which I

made a special video you can see that  You

can see through it you can earn a regular income

but as I said the

biggest problem is because it

is little

up and down everyday so if you

need that regular income on a day when the

market is down  If you have then you will have to sell a lot of your

investments you get money due want for example and



try to like it on the screen I will

help you suppose you put ₹ 1 lakh

in a mutual fund if the mutual fund was ₹ 10

then you got 10000 units  10000 *

10 lakhs

you get this ₹ 1 lakh

means every month you spend thousand rupees

this ₹ 1 lakh should be retained then you



will make a S&P or a Systematic Withdrawal Plan

you sell him 100 units for thousand rupees

because  That ₹ 10 only the witch is

great no problem how many

units have you sold 100 units

how many have you bought the 10000 so how many

children do you have 9000900 units this is simple

math but one day this ₹ 10 mutual

fund  Yes it became ₹ 9 so to get the same ₹ 1000

now you have to sell 111 units

not 100 units so what happened because the

market was down your units which you had to

sell had increased may not be good

because now your 900 units  Out of that

you have deducted 111 units instead of say and debt

mens your money is being

spent quickly debt is the same second

process of regular income which is mutual

funds or stock market in general these not always

work for you  If you want something that is stable,

then come number three. Realistic real

estate is a very interesting option

because you can get a regular rental income,

whether it is commercial or

residential, but the big problem with real estate is that

a lot of money

ultimately  Have to spend in the beginning

end debt min not be something debt

you can do right nine I don't have the ability to go to a

shop buy done buy another bond what

c already stay in so

give me real estate for me bikams out of d  Question

but if you have

30 40 lakh rupees for lamps or baby give more than that and

buy real estate and

generate a rental income from it is a great way to create



it is called rental yield



Milta hai and what is it date further on

percentage of d value of d property

for example if your property is

forge 1 crore rupees and you

get 3 lakh rupees a year rent means

25000 rupees a month rent today then your rental yield

Gai 3% means use investment jo

aapne kari hai ₹ 1 crore ki aapko 3% every year aapko aapko ki aapko aapko 3% aapko hai

again not something debt should make you

happy but de reason wahi u still do it

this 3% se toh kuch bhi sakte nahin ugadega

because ye to  Inflation is also not beating

but your property value is also

increasing so d growth of d

property plus d rental yield is your

actual return real

estate usually grow at 5 to 6%

means if your 5 to 6% property  The

value of the property is increasing and suppose your rental yield is

3% then your annual

return is around 7 to 8% that beats

inflation that's why real estate jump will be a good

option only if you have enough money its an

alternate where  You

don't have that much money to spend but you

want to enjoy real estate A Income

Jump B

Rate Real Estate Investment Trust the

name of all three of them are Mindspace Brookfield and

Embassy according to me Embassy is the best

but again my advice  Don't take your

analysis do your own research they invest

money starting from 400 to date this work is up 400

so this is like a

stock when you buy IIT of a company

then technical you are buying stock of a company

then imagine Embassy and



You will get back a percentage of the rental income generated by all the properties you own,

further dividend which is regular

income through it's rental income date is one way

date you can start getting money from real

estate investment without spending that much

money then  THINK YOU NEED TO NOTE

THIS YOU DO NOT GET CAPITAL APPRECIATION

YOU ONLY GET DIVIDEND ON D RENTAL

INCOME SO WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF BUYING REAL ESTATE THAT THE

VALUE OF YOUR PROPERTY IS ALSO



INCREASING  But the disadvantage is that

you are not able to enjoy the benefit of property appreciation.











Ye hai ki aapka jo

return hai woh inflation ko bhi nahi beat

Bonds are higher return give

inflation bonds hote hai company basically

f announce karti hai for customer like u and

I to farz kariye Ankur bari ko company hai

usse ek very big koi project  He has got

and

he is putting some of his own money to execute the project,

but if he needs more money, he takes some

from the bank, then he does it from the bank, some of his

own vendors take cars from them,

but some  Paisa woh bolte hain ki

yaar hum retail investor or institution

investor se uthaiye and del on something called

bonds they say that for small

duration because usually one to

three maximum four years is the duration

in which we will take money from you and take loan

and  Aapko ek guaranteed rate of return denge to

d thing this guarantee guarantee means

fixed rate of return toh woh up

nahi jaayega like stock market ke and you will get

un regular income through out d

period of d loan

what is the biggest research  If

God pleases the crispy company, if

something happens to the project, if something happens to the status of the company,

then all your

money can sink in one go, that is why it is

very important that if you

buy any corporate bond or  Invest in it

then buy it carefully from such a platform

or buy it after doing such research that

you know that the chances of date happening are very very low

for example wind wealth is

a platform where they say

investing bounds offering 9 to 11%

fixed detergent  If I try to explore the fixed returns of this D,



then all are sold out now, but if you

go inside and see, Virar, which

was taken out in September 22, basically

you will get interest payment every 6 months, so every 6

months you will get a regular income.

You will continue to get the principal, it will also be returned every six

months, so there is a safety,



you will not get it, you will continue to get it every six months, the

minimum investment is only ₹ 10000

and this is an excise of 15 crores.



BF industry leading

experts in two wheeler finance ok so two

wheeler financing karti hai and this is very important

ko lateral kya hai to agar

khuda se like I told aapke company

ko kuch ho jaata to ho do u insure ki

ye paisa aapka seeker hai  D ve debt ventwell this trying to do this

saying whatever we are

raising this 15 cr 1.2x + whatever

our interest will be generated through this bond

we have sought like loan

so we have customer's two wheeler  It is a loan

that the customer has to pay because

he has taken a loan from us to buy this two wheeler

and it is like our collateral,

so if Forever Reasons goes out of business,

we will still have the launch



dnbfc  rating is bbb+ to ek scale hota hai

of corporate bond ratings triple a is

d best then double a then a then triple b

so on and so forth to triple b is actually

not very good my suggestion would be

that you any bonds below A  me

kabhi invest na karen but de way if i want

you just show u ho this works is de following

to yahan 10000 tu 29 rupees ka ek

lot hai means you basically return one lot

then do first kariye we are spending around ₹ 1 lakh

hai to hum 10 stall kote hain and what is it

that you will basically spend the money

after 6 months you will

get 5797 plus 25000 will be returned to your principal

then you will get this interest which is your

regular income and your

principal amount will also be returned to you

then  After 6 months you will get around 4280

and your ₹ 25000 will be the

end which will be on August 2024 where

you will get ₹ 1400 interest today which will have

earned its return and also your last 25000

rupees back with nothing outstanding so

this is ho it plazo  If you try to net it

then you will delve 10 units

approximately one lakh ₹ 2000

and you will

get @ 14000 rupees which is approximately

10.5% rate of return

this is over a period of whatever less than 2

years because  It is starting from FB

so in FB you will give first money and then

next year in August then 23 first

money and 24 full money back then

within about 1.5 years you will get ₹ 14000

for your ₹ 12000 investment like  You will keep

growing as you will get so bonds is also

great way you make money from

investment so that you keep getting a regular income

and finally invoice

discounting many clubs have opened

where you get a fixed rate of

return I have never

done that much  All people ask me

for example there is a 12% club which you

can see on screen basically

you get 12% fixed rate of return

and good thing tha they claim is that you get a

daily return then you can get that

money anytime  You can withdraw if you delve ₹ 1 lakh

then at the end of the year you will

get ₹ 12000 but you can withdraw anytime during the day also

if you have ever

without any call

if you have to break any investment without any

other penalty like  They

claim that there are no withdrawal charges, you



can withdraw whatever interest you have reduced and date it, it

works, I am not a big fan of debt, but

frankly, because I have

not done it, I dismiss it.  I do not

want to do this, please

try them at your own risk, my problem with them is

that either this is the basic question,

where is this free gem coming from, that who is giving 12%,

now this 12% is either those people  Those

who have brought this money for free, then they have

no expenses, so they

can give 12% or they are giving the same money to someone else

and asking 14% from him, then you are

net net 2  % earns which is what banks do

when you get that HD return

4 to 6% where does it come from because someone

else and you are the ones when you take personal loan

education loan take home loan then

you  se give 810% you are

getting fixed deposit 4 to 6% which is the rest

difference which is spread which is called as

bank's income it is income from se they can this also be

so I am not sir what is

de collateral aate  D end of it aur agar

khuda na khasta company ka kuch hota hai to

kaise yeh 12% sikar hote but for short

term i can se un devosified

approach can work to in punch things me agar

aapna paise batte wich ise hd  Here you

will put only the amount that you

want to seek. Emergency Fund is a

great place to put your ft because whatever is

your expenses for 6 months or 12 months

which you have kept as emergency fund, it is

very good to put in HD  But

not more than that because it is

not an investment product it is a safety

product so you can put this date in any number of

mutual funds but

in Systematic Withdrawal Plan you will have to

take care of the ups and downs so the message is that

you can invest in mutual funds or stocks  Look at market or

small case only for long term investment do



n't look for short term regular income number three real estate if

you have money plz don't you

can buy R IIT but rate of

return is not that exciting

will be as much as you can make in real estate

number four you can invest in bonds are

very good

bonds of very good companies come so if you

analyze them carefully wind spread

goldenfy.com ho gaya these are all

properties  Where you can go and evaluate bonds,

check out

and if you do, you will understand which

company is trying to give which bond for what

period of time and its through 9

to 12 or 9-1% fixed rate of return note  All

for regular income and short period and

finally this p2p landing and all of solid which

you can use but my suggestion will be 5 se 10%

vyada apna wo paisa deploy kariyega I

hope in punch options me aap apne

investment ke through a regular income

generate  can and make dose

investment work for you right no vile you are long term

investment r working for you for d long term

125,Not Misleading,"hi it's mark so have you ever had a

hundred dollars in your pocket and

wondered how you could turn it into a

thousand ten thousand or even a hundred

thousand dollars well sadly this isn't

something they teach in school come to

think of it it'd have been pretty

awesome if they had because of this lack

of knowledge it seems pretty scary for

most beginners to get started in

investing but in today's video i'm going

to simplify the whole process invest in

my money allow me to become a

multi-millionaire and guess what i

started with that's right a hundred

dollars well probably less than that to

be honest i'm not saying becoming rich

is easy but by taking calculated risks

you'll be able to grow your wealth over

time i understand everyone has a

different risk tolerance so today i'm

going to be revealing how to invest for

beginners with a hundred dollars and as

we go through the video the risk is

going to increase but remember as the

risk goes up so does the potential

reward i'll also be putting my money

where my mouth is and investing a

hundred dollars into each one of these

options so you can see exactly how to do

it i'm just about to invest in something

i never thought i'd actually do it goes

when someone asks me how they should

invest a hundred dollars i usually say

invest in yourself you can do this by

buying books and improving your skills

but assuming you've already done this

now we're going to be talking about the

specific places you can actually put

your money now i'm a businessman i'm not

a financial advisor these are just some

of the ways i've invested my money over

the years and they've worked for me you

can also sit back and relax because i'm

not going to try and sell you anything

at the end just remember if you enjoyed

the video then smash that like button

because it really helps push this video

out to more people and also consider

subscribing if you want to grow your

wealth the first investment is a high

interest savings account this is a one

out of ten on the risco so the lowest

possible risk that you can have nowadays

it's extremely hard to find any savings

account that will pay a substantial

amount of interest but that's not the

main reason it's on the list by putting

your money into a savings account you're

actually starting to create what i like

to call an emergency fund which i

believe everyone should have this is

money that you can access if something

unexpected comes up and it's extremely

low risk and by having money on hand you

can avoid getting into debt and having

to pay crazy fees back i remember when i

bought my first apartment i had a minor

crisis after about two months as a hot

water system went wrong and it needed

replacing because of my emergency fund

it saved me over 200 as i didn't have to

take out a payday loan when you leave

your money in the bank it slowly loses

its value so when i am looking for the

best savings account to combat this i

look for two things the first of course

is a good interest rate which depends on

the economy mostly the second thing is

having the ability to access my money

instantly some banks that are really

worth looking at and consistently have a

good rate of interest are ally bank

markets by goldman sachs and citibank i

currently have an account with markers

by goldman sachs and their interest rate

is 0.7 which isn't very high but it is

currently one of the best available so

there we go nice and easy 100 deposited

into my savings account now for gold

often referred to as a safe haven i'll

give this also a 2 out of 10 on the risk

out did you know that since the creation

of the federal reserve in 1913 the us

dollar has lost 95 percent of its value

so you're actually only left with five

percent of its original purchasing power

so if you want to stop your money losing

value then maybe gold is for you if you

had a hundred dollar nugget of gold in

the year 2000 it would now be worth

approximately 580.

the piece of gold hasn't actually

changed in size it's still the same

piece of metal but what has actually

changed is the value of your dollar and

how much gold you can buy with it gold

was actually our original currency used

by our forefathers i remember those days

well it's perfect as it can't be

manufactured and it lasts for thousands

and thousands of years so if you've ever

watched gold rush on tv you'll know how

hard it is to actually mine this stuff

out of the ground now you may be

wondering if it's so safe why have i

given it a 2 out of 10 on the risco it

all comes down to opportunity cost you

have to ask yourself if you really want

to just protect your 100 against

inflation or if you want to invest it in

other opportunities

which could make it grow a lot quicker

if you invest in gold then you would be

missing out on these potential profits

making it a little bit risky i would say

that this is the perfect investment if

you have a lot of money already and all

you want to do is just protect it there

are two different ways that you can

invest in gold the first way would be to

actually buy physical gold but if i

bought jewelry i know gold bars coins

and that sort of thing i'd probably be

paying too much because the person

selling it would want to make a profit

which means i would be paying more than

the true value of the gold itself the

alternative is to invest in gold within

a broker app like robin hood in the usa

or trading 212 in the uk then you're

able to buy gold at its true value and

have the option to sell much quicker in

the usa i would look for the gld etf on

robin hood which is one of the largest

gold etfs in the world as of june 2020

they hold over

million ounces of gold in vaults all

around the world as i'm currently in the

uk i'm gonna invest using trade in two

one two in a similar share and with just

a click of a button there you go i'm now

mr gold man if that doesn't sound

exciting enough for you then why don't

you try a simple low-cost index fund

i'll give this a 3 out of 10 on the risk

scale if you invested just 100 per month

into an index fund with a 7 annual

return then after 30 years you'd have

123 thousand dollars that's the power of

compound interest you can do all of this

without having any knowledge of the

stock market i remember when warren

buffett one of the richest men in the

world placed a million dollar bet that a

simple s p 500 index fund would

outperform a professionally picked

portfolio of hedge funds over a 10-year

period now this contest wrapped up in

2017 and the results were made public

warren buffett had actually won a

million dollar bet which really shows

the power of index funds and that the

everyday person can take on the pros

with little to no knowledge imagine an

index fund is like a bag of haribo

gummies the machine in the factory puts

a range of the most popular candy into

one bag so you can enjoy the best of the

best without having to pick and buy each

and every one individually now just

replace the candy with companies that's

what an index fund is you can buy your

own selection bag of the most popular

companies in the world such as apple

microsoft amazon and facebook and your

money is split between all of them now

let's go back to the haribos imagine you

left these on the side and they're open

for a few days or so they'd go hard and

they certainly wouldn't taste as good

would they but by putting them in a

container you can stop that from

happening

this is very much like index funds is if

you leave them unprotected the

government will start taxing you on the

profits you make but you can protect

them with a sort of container like this

which is known as different things in

different countries in america it's

called a roth ira and in the uk it's an

isa these containers allow you to

protect your money after tax and then

any profits you make are yours to keep

but because they're so good and they're

so powerful there's a cap on how much

you're allowed to invest each year so if

i was you i would take full advantage as

soon as possible and max out your

allowance there are more in-depth

strategies you can use but for the

purpose of this video i'm going to be

investing a hundred dollars into an s p

500 index fund which over the last 20

years has an average yearly return of

seven percent drop a like if you'd like

a full video covering this topic because

there's so much on this we could talk

about but mark a hundred dollars isn't

enough as the s p 500 is over three

thousand dollars a share well you don't

actually have to buy a full share to

invest my favorite brokers are fidelity

child swap and vanguard so if we head

over to vanguard's website now and we

find the s p 500 here you can see what

companies are in the index fund so you

can buy the right one so all you have to

do is create an account i already have

one and deposit some money and then

click there you go job done the fourth

way to invest is in a real estate

investment trust otherwise known as a

reit i'll also give this a three out of

ten on the risk scout now imagine your

friend collected a hundred dollars from

three thousand people he will have three

hundred thousand dollars then he takes

this money and he buys a property he

rents it out and splits it with all

three 000 people that helped him buy the

property which helps them start

generating some of that sweet passive

income that's the basic way of

explaining a reit it lets everyone

benefit from investing in income

producing properties without actually

buying one think of it like buying a

small share in a property let's say you

own the front door someone else owns the

windows and a few other people own all

the bricks but all together you own the

property equity reits own things like

offices shopping centers apartments

hotels and much more and they get their

income through the rent by law they have

to pass on 90 of all profits to the

investor like a dividend however they're

taxed a little differently the cool

thing is that at the start of 2019 the

10-year average return for re-etfs did

better than the s p 500 with an average

return of 10

if you're in the usa by investing in the

vg slx by vanguard you can average a 12

percent return which beats the average

real estate investor how awesome is that

as i'm in the uk i'm going to use the

trading 212 website to put a hundred

dollars into a similar reit it has high

global diversification meaning i can

invest in all the up and coming property

markets around the world the next option

is buying and selling items the risk on

this really depends on how good you are

at finding great deals but i'll give

this a i know four out of ten on the

risk scale the good thing about doing

this is that you can buy and sell

something that you're interested in and

have knowledge about which can lead to

bigger possible returns now i'm going to

invest my hundred dollars in either

pre-owned radio control model gear or

golf equipment both of these i've got an

interest in so i should have a

reasonable idea of what each item is

worth pokemon cards would be a great

area to have some expertise in as their

value at the moment is skyrocketing

logan paul just bought a charizard card

for over 150

dollars how mad is that so i've been on

facebook marketplace as most people have

access to that platform and i found

myself a model engine that i'm going to

go and try and buy it's up for 75 pounds

which is approximately 100 us dollars we

sent a few messages back and forth and

i'm going to go and have a look at the

item now

hello there i've come about the engine

oh in the box as well cool that's good

cool it looks right so would you take 70

for it no i've got 75. this box in good

condition

can you do a bit better i'll tell you

what i can do

there you go i'll throw that in really

that's what it came out of 75 quid

that's that's a deal okay there you go

i'll give you 75 quid there you go and

we're videoing this for our youtube

channel do you mind no that's fine all

right then see you again thanks a lot

thanks for that

so i've done a listing on ebay for the

model engine and the model plane i'm

going to actually advertise on a

specialized website for model flying as

i'm sure i'll be then selling to the

right people and hoping for big profits

now we're starting to get serious it's

time for individual stocks this gets a

6.5 out of 10 on the risk scale there's

a certain amount of risk that comes with

investing in individual stocks but if

you pick your companies well then it can

be really exciting is there's the

potential to make a lot of money during

a dot-com boom back in 1995 i was really

lucky to pick a few great stocks which i

cashed in and i made a lot of money in a

very short period of time when the

bubble burst some of the companies i'd

held on to which has cost me very little

went completely out of business luck and

timing can be a very crucial part of

stock investing i picked these stocks

using what's called fundamental analysis

which means i looked at the business

financial statements their market and

also the leadership of their companies

back then this was a lot of work but now

it's easily found out on yahoo finance a

while ago i read an article about an

experiment where they simulated 100

monkeys throwing darts

like this at the financial pages of a

newspaper the stocks the monkeys picked

on average outperformed the so-called

smartish hedge fund managers on wall

street so for this video i thought it'd

be fun to put this theory to the test i

don't have a monkey so i thought i'd

have to do so i'm going to throw a dart

at the board and as you can see i've

randomly selected 20 different stocks

and wherever the dart lands that's what

i'm going to invest in now i've just got

to put on a blindfold okay here we go

right let's see what we got

and we've gone into samsung

right so i'm going to jump straight onto

my brokerage account and set an order

for samsung

if you want to invest your hundred

dollars in individual stock then weibo

are currently giving away three free

stocks for a limited time when you

deposit a hundred dollars into your

account i'll just leave the link in the

description if you want to pick up those

free stocks so now we're going to be

moving into the realm of gambling and

speculation rather than investing number

seven is cryptocurrency this is a 9 out

of 10 on the risco so you've probably

heard of bitcoin this is currently the

most popular type of crypto if you had

bought a hundred dollars worth of

bitcoin in 2015

today it would have been worth around

about five thousand dollars that's a 5

000 return on your investment and that's

pretty unheard of therefore many people

that invested in bitcoin in the early

days became millionaires overnight but a

lot of people also lost money if you'd

invested around a hundred dollars in

december 2017 when bitcoin was at an

all-time high by december 2018 you'd

have had less than 17 left so really no

one really knows what it's going to do

next it's extremely risky but still very

attractive because it has the potential

to make you millions there are three

main types of cryptos these are ethereum

ripple and obviously the big one bitcoin

but let's just focus on bitcoin today if

you want to learn more about other types

of coins you can read something called a

white paper and it will give you all the

details the cool thing about bitcoin is

that it uses something called blockchain

and it isn't regulated by the government

you also can't create any more bitcoins

which makes inflation absolutely

impossible in my opinion this investment

will probably only make sense if you're

investing an extra hundred dollars that

you don't really need so i'm going to

jump onto the most popular bitcoin app

which is called coinbase and invest my

hundred dollars in bitcoin and forget

about it

by the way if you want to give this a

try i'll put a link to coinbase in the

description down below and you can pick

up ten dollars of free bitcoin at least

that gives you a bit of a head start the

last is definitely a full-on gamble you

may have guessed it already it's the

lotto this is definitely a 10 out of 10

on the risco and isn't something i would

recommend doing however i thought i'd

include it in this investing video as so

many people choose to do it in fact 57

of all americans buy at least one lotto

ticket per year the chance of actually

winning is 1 in 14 million which might

sound quite possible but let me just try

and put that into a bit of perspective

you're 4 000 times more likely to win an

oscar than win the lotto millions of

people lose their money every year but

they keep playing as the rewards are sky

high if you win i'm just about to invest

in something i never thought i'd

actually do it goes can i have 100

scratch cards please

lovely thank you very much thank you

cheers and thanks bye as you can see

this is going to take me quite a while

i'm going to leave a counter on the

screen so you can see how much i've

spent versus how much i've earned back

from my investment let's do this

[Music]

i hope there's a bit more in this lot

there's got to be hasn't it

so we're halfway through the most we've

earned so far is three dollars on one

ticket i'm going to need some help i've

got 50 more to go come on curtis i know

you've been itching to have a go at this

have you got your coin ready i do ready

let's race to see wait for it who can

find the most money in the remaining 50

cards ready okay on your marks get

set go

y'all ready to go

come on


really yeah no yeah

oh wow 15.

he's only just started doing this he's

got more than me

[Applause]

find a 2x to win two times that must be

ten dollars we think is that ten dollars

ten dollars ten dollars

[Laughter]

you say you're smashing me but i'll tell

you what how about this how about this

another dollar

[Music]

[Laughter]

[Music]

you're ready now i'm making my move

better

cause i'm coming through i'll tell you

what this has gotta be an astonishing

last four cards if we're gonna get any

money back from this so we just came

back and we double checked it we made

back fifty dollars from our hundred

dollar investment now you may think that

sounds pretty good but that's actually a

negative fifty percent return this was

meant to be a little bit of fun but it's

pretty sad to think that people play

this regularly and on average are losing

half their money when they could pick

any one of the other investments in this

video and have a much better chance of

being successful i hope this has taken

some of the mystery away from the other

forms of investing and made them a

little bit more understandable for

beginners if you'd like me to make a

part two of this video to see how these

investments have done over a month then

make sure to smash that thumbs up button

to let me know i'm going to leave the

next video here but don't click on it

just yet remember to subscribe to the

channel and ring that notification bell

so you don't miss out on part two okay

i'll see you on the other side


"

oh

[Music]

hey folks say rachana ranade here and i

welcome you all to another brand new

lecture which is on

how to start investing in your 20s if

you are in your 20s i'm sure you might

have just finished your education

or you might have just started earning

so this is a very important phase of

your life

when it comes to starting investing

early so if you want to know about all

these basics

let's begin right away

let's understand the top 3 reasons why

you should start investing

early so the very first reason if you

remember i said mere past work there

so if someone starts investing at the

age of 21 or 22

you can imagine that that person will be

investing from this age

till the age of 60 almost so you can

imagine what a big corpus that person

will have for his retirement purpose

right number one

number two is that because you start

early

you have the benefit of risk averaging

now you will be like what is this risk

averaging just have a look at this nifty

chart

now i'll give you a practical example i

qualified as a chartered accountant in

the year 2008

have a look at that chat in 2008 so

that's where i started investing

and as usual as a new investor starts

investing immediately there's a market

fall everyone knows what happened in

2008.

now you can imagine had i stopped

investing because in a market as a

sister

okay whenever i start investing it will

go down and all that

that would have been a big negative

point for me what i did

i kept on that discipline of investing

at regular intervals so what might have

happened i invested in 2008 i invested

in 2009

10 and now you can see at 11 already it

has come back to the level of 2008

again i kept on investing 12 13 14 15.

20 i'm investing till date and now you

can

compare the level of 2008 with the level

of 2020.

it has majorly increased since then

so can i say because i invested in a

disciplined way

because i invested at every specific

time interval my risk was

automatically averaged out so i hope you

have understood this pri a point of risk

averaging

and the last important point is that you

can have a very nice compounding effect

if you start investing early but how is

what we are going to check out

immediately

let's understand how an amazing effect

of compounding can be seen

if you start investing early okay so we

have to give some basic inputs inputs

like what you have to give your input of

your current age

you have to give an input of what will

be your retirement age

right third thing you have to give an

input of how much will be your monthly

investment amount okay generally we talk

about investing

very systematically like like a sip

systematic investment plan right

and number four input that you have to

give is how much returns do you expect

okay let's say we are taking we are

going to take a return of 10

which is not very high if i'm going to

talk about a longer time frame

so shall we start in inputting the data

yes okay

so the very first one is current age

what is your current age

okay 21 21 okay

at what time do you want to retire now i

will tell you 60 okay

assume 60 how much are you going to

invest monthly minimum target i'm going

to give you

10 000 rupees monthly you have to invest

okay

let's assume that you are going to get a

10 return

over how much time time frame 39 years

that's a longer time frame

if you do this systematically over a

period of 39 years every single month

without missing even one month you are

going to

get an amazing return and your final

amount is going to be

5 crore 76 lakhs 8

714 amazing just by investing 10k per

month

you are going to get that 5 crore plus

amount now understand how compounding

works meri password how does that work

if you start investing at the age of 40

that amount is going to be just 76 lakhs

okay i hope you have understood how big

a difference can be created

if you start investing early and if you

have that financial discipline in you

now let's understand the top three

things that young investors should

avoid while investing the very first one

is to follow the advice of your friends

tipindra okay because that person is

just going to give you hot tips and

you're going to just

blindly rely on him so don't do that

don't invest based on tipendra

number two mistake which many people do

is that

[Applause]

exactly that's what they do they invest

in the market without having proper

knowledge

so if you do that again you're going to

fall flat on your face and you're going

to make losses

don't do that and number three is that

please don't follow the herd mentality

there are going to be many people who

are going to just invest because their

friends are investing

and their friends are investing because

their friends are investing and none of

them knows why they are investing

so avoid the herd mentality

now let's try and understand where can

you invest your money

i'm sure everyone knows that there are

two major options one is equity

and the other one is debt okay now

question is how much should you invest

in equity

there is a very standard thumb rule

which says that hundred minus your age

should be your percentage investment in

equity my math is not that good so

assume that my age is 25 okay

so in this case how much will be

investment in equity it will be 100

minus 25 so 75 percent of my investment

should go in

equity and 25 should go in debt

now the next question arises is that if

i were to invest in equity

how and where can i invest in equity

that depends on certain factors there

are various possibilities

possibility number one is that you

invest directly in equities okay

when can you explore this you can

explore this if you have

knowledge or possibility number two

you're prepared

to gain that much knowledge by maybe uh

watching a lot of youtube videos

or checking out my various courses on my

website rashnarani.com or whatever

reading books as well right

so that you can do when you have

knowledge in stock market or you're

ready to gain knowledge in stock market

possibility number two you're not sure

about a specific stock

but you're sure about a specific theme

we are going to talk about

this in the immediate next part of the

video right and possibility number three

is that you are neither sure about a

specific stock nor are you sure about a

specific theme

but you are sure about the overall

direction in the market so you

remember that nifty chart from 2008 to


it has gone in the upward direction so

you feel that all in all it will go up

so i want to invest directly in nifty

can you do that answer is yes by

investing in nifty b's

for that i have a separate video on how

and what are these what are the

different types

so whenever time permits you can check

out that video as well

so now let's understand how can we

invest in a specific

team theme of investing with a small

amount and theme

of investing in top 100 companies top

100 based on what top 100 based on their

market capitalization

for that we have a top 100 small case

which

invests in nippon india nifty 50 bctf

and nippon india junior bctf the

weightage is also very clearly given

32.98 and 67.01

respectively now if you check the

overview as well

this this small case has clearly

outperformed the equity large

cap we also need to check what is the

minimum investment amount it's just

554 rupees what is the cagr cagr is

16.91

so i think both our purposes of

investing in top 100 companies by market

capitalization

with a small amount or just 554 rupees

is very well suited in the small case so

if you want to start your investment

journey

just check out the link in the

description box also if you want to have

a little bit of higher risk there is one

more small case which is known as the

value and momentum small case you can

also check out the link in description

for that

but again be aware that second small

case is only for those

who are ready to take a shade higher

risk

let's understand how can you start

investing in debt

now there are two options that we are

going to discuss primarily today one

is investing in ppf the other one is

investing in alternate funds like what

something like a gold fund or something

like a debt fund but first

let's start with ppf very first and

foremost point that you should know

about ppf is that it has a lock-in

period of 15 years

why am i talking about this 15 years if

you start

early you will be comfortable at a very

young age

means what i started investing in ppf

when i was 21

and in the next year in if i'm talking

about current scenario in the next year

i would have completed my 15 years okay

so calculate my age that's

homework but anyways next year i would

have completed 15 years so my major

lock-in is over now

can i extend my ppf yes now extension

happens only for five

five years so my lock-in is drastically

reduced now so i hope you have

understood the importance of starting

your ppf at a very young age

with how much amount can i start

investing only with 500 rupees you can

start your investment journey in ppf you

can invest 500 rupees every month that

is allowed

what is the maximum limit maximum limit

is 1 lakh 50 000 rupees

whatever interest you're going to get is

going to be absolutely tax free and the

interest rate currently

is 7.1 right also you get

a benefit under section 80c of the

income tax act when you invest in ppf

right

now let's move on with the second point

that we are going to talk about

investing in gold fund or investing in a

debt fund

if you invest in gold we typically say

that gold act as a

acts as a very good hedge against the

market volatility

it's always said that equity and gold

move in the opposite direction

okay so that's why i'm saying that

investing in gold makes sense

as a good hedging parameter second one

is a basic thumb rule wherein we say

that

never put all your eggs in one basket so

even if pps

ppf is good don't invest entirely in ppf

invest some in ppf some in gold

some in debt that will give you good

overall balancing

number three if you're investing in gold

or in debt there is a chance that you

may earn a shade higher

than 7.1 percent right so i hope you

have understood

that even if i'm talking about

investment in debt there are various

options available in the market

now let's understand how can a portfolio

allocation be done is this the

only way where in the portfolio

allocation can be done no this is just

an example that i'm telling you

now if you observe very carefully i've

done two major parts

the left one which talks about 75

percent that is investing in equity

right one talks about investing in debt

now if you check out debt i have given


equal allocation to ppf and to gold.debt

funds okay

can that percentage vary from investor

to investor it can have given this

as an example if you go to that 75

percent category

now there have given different splits

based on what based on the investors

profile

three category of investor profile low

risk moderate risk and high risk

here you can see that a person was low

risk have given zero percent

for stock sips directly into stock

market and if you see the highest

category person you can see that 45

allocation can be given in direct in

equity investing

so all in all i hope you have understood

how based on risk profile your equity

exposure

the way in which you invest in equity

can change from person to person

if you want me to make a separate video

on how to calculate risk

please let me know in the comment

section i'll make a separate video for

you

well is there any small case which talks

about investing in equity

in debt as well as in gold all at the

same point in time answer is yes

the name of that small case is all

weather investing

of course again link is there in the

description this small case has given a

cagr of almost 13.63

well i hope you have enjoyed this video

and if you have don't forget to share it

with your friends

even if you are not in your 20s even if

you are there in your 40s or 50s you can

share it with your neighbors with your

relatives

and help me spread financial literacy

and financial awareness amongst everyone

till then take care and bye

127,Not Misleading'',"That is the super concise investing definition that comes courtesy of Merriam-Webster. Regardless of where you invest your money, you're essentially giving your money to a company, government, or other entity in the hope they provide you with more money in the future. People generally invest money with a specific goal in mind, for example, retirement, their children's education, a house — the list goes on.

Investing is different from saving or trading. Generally investing is associated with putting money away for a long period of time rather than trading stocks on a more regular basis. Investing is riskier than saving money. Savings are sometimes guaranteed but investments are not. If you were to keep your money under the mattress and not invest — you'd never have more money than what you've put away yourself.


That's why many people choose to invest their money. There are many things you can put money into. Here are just a few of those things.

Types of Investments
Stocks
Bonds
ETFs
Mutual funds
Cash equivalents
Real estate

Now we know you're eager to learn the investing basics given that you're reading this article. But let's hold for a second and figure out if you should be investing in the first place.

Invest as little as a dollar on autopilot with Wealthsimple — take our risk-free survey and we'll provide you with a personalized portfolio to suit your needs.
Things to consider before investing
First things first. Before you start investing in anything, you should ask yourself a couple important questions. These questions determine whether you’re in good enough financial shape to start investing right now — here are the basics:

1. Do you have a lot of credit card debt?

If the answer is yes, you’re probably not in a position to invest quite yet. First, do everything you can do to erase that debt, because no investment you’ll find will consistently outperform the 14% or so APR that you’re likely forking over to a credit card company to service your debt. Here’s a good place to start plotting your debt’s annihilation.

2. Do you have an emergency fund?

In polite terms, poop happens. Layoffs, natural disasters, sicknesses — let us count the ways in which your life can be turned upside down. Any financial advisor will tell you that in order to avoid total ruin you should have between six months and a year of total living expenses in cash, or in a savings account should the unthinkable happen. If you don’t, bookmark this article, start saving, and come back just as soon as you’ve got that emergency fund squared away.


Beginners investing tips
Before we go over the specifics of what you should consider investing in, be it stocks, bonds, or your cousin Brian’s yakalo farm — let’s first go over the basics of how one invests.

Investing is what happens when at the end of the month, after the bills are paid, you’ve got a few dollars left over to put towards your future. No investing happens without putting money away. How are you supposed to find those elusive extra dollars to save? Here’s how.

Avoid lifestyle creep

In all likelihood, you’ll earn more in your thirties than you did in your twenties, and even more than that in your forties. The key to saving is to do your absolute best to avoid what’s called “lifestyle creep”. If you haven't heard of this before, let us explain.

Lifestyle creep means that as you make more money, what once seemed like luxuries become necessities. Whole roasted pigeon and oyster concassé may be sublime and all but just because you have the $626 in your checking account to cover the tasting menu at Guy Savoy doesn’t mean you should. Instead, you should do your very best to live the same way you’ve always lived. Then put away the extra money you’re making from your raises rather than increase your spending. Skip the pigeon, get yourself a croque monsieur, and invest the 600 bucks you saved!

Start investing — even a little at a time

Once you’ve got savings, you’ll absolutely want to invest. Inflation will almost always outpace the interest rate that you’ll be able to get on a savings account. You’ll be effectively be saving and losing money at the same time. This is why you should start investing as soon as you can.

Investing is not just for the Warren Buffet's of the world. If you are finding it tough to put away some investing money each month, try using a spare change app. These services round-up your purchases, allowing you to invest small amounts of money that you'd hardly miss. For example, if you spent $3.39 on a coffee then $0.61 would be invested.

Investing small amounts of money is a great habit to get into and your money will add up over time. If you're looking for more easy ways to invest with little money, here they are.

How can I Invest with Little Money?
Invest quarters at a time using a spare change app
Set up small, monthly transfers from your checking account
Use a low-cost investing service
Brew your own coffee, invest your Starbucks money
Immediately invest any tax returns
Invest any raises instead of altering your lifestyle
Ask relatives for investing money, rather than other gifts
Know what you're investing for

How you invest depends on what exactly you're investing for. You might be investing money to help your 14 year old with her upcoming university tuition. You might want to invest money to live off when you retire in 30 years or so. The time horizons on each of these investments are very different. Because you'll need access to some of them sooner than others. Those with shorter horizons should invest more conservatively. Those investing money they don't need for a long time can choose riskier investments.

Understand the risk you are taking

Before deciding where to invest, you’ll need to first assess your personal risk tolerance. This is a fancy way of saying how much of your investment you can really afford to lose. If you need money for next month’s rent, you have a very low-risk tolerance. If your life wouldn’t be materially affected in any way, if rather than investing money, you set fire to it, your risk tolerance is through the roof. Risk tolerance is often dictated by your so-called “time horizon”. This may sound like something you’d hear on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise, but instead, it's just a term that means the length of time you’ll hold a particular investment.


Savings accounts are typically seen as low risk. They are appropriate for holding your emergency fund, rainy day money, or this month rent. Investing is much more suited to money you don't need in the short term, for example your retirement savings, or a fund for your child's university education.

Diversify your investments

Rather than zero-in on some stock you think will perform well, diversify your investments. In doing this, if one part of your investment doesn't do well you haven't lost everything. Michael Allen, an advisor at Wealthsimple explains that diversifying your portfolio means investing in many different geographies, industries, and asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate etc).

To potentially smooth out your investment returns over time you could put your money in many investments that are uncorrelated with one another.

Allen explains that fluctuations aren't necessarily the biggest risk for investors in it for the long haul. A potentially bigger risk is how you react to the fluctuations. Many investors find it difficult to stick to their investing plan—particularly during market movements. A diversified portfolio that's prone to less market movements can come in useful to help manage your emotions.

If all this portfolio diversification talk sounds like hard work — that's because it is. Automated investing is a good alternative for someone who wants to diversify their portfolio but doesn't want to go to the effort of buying multiple assets such as stocks, bonds and real estate by themselves.

Invest for the long-term

If you can, invest for the long term. Many studies demonstrate that investors who hold onto stocks for more than 10 years will be rewarded with higher returns that offset short-term risks. That's not to say this trend will continue, or that risk is ever totally eliminated. Risk never disappears, but you might say it mellows with age.

If you can put money away for a long time period, then you can afford to have investments that are typically more susceptible to rising and falling. Your portfolio can contain a mix of stocks and equities that are typically more volatile compared to bonds.

Get started investing — Wealthsimple is investing on autopilot.
Regardless of how long you're investing for, diversifying your portfolio is an absolute must. One thing is also for sure — if you invest for a long time period you benefit from the power of compounding. This is the process by which the money you make earns interest on itself over time. The earlier you start investing, the more you benefit from compounding over time.

Watch out for high fees

Fees are the money you put into someone's pocket rather than your own. Regardless of how you invest, you're going to pay fees. What you need to watch out for is high fees. They'll have a significant drag on your returns. You need to consider the value you're getting in exchange for paying fees.

Here's how fees impact gains on a $10,000 initial investment with a $300 monthly contribution for thirty years (assumes a return of 5.48%).

Investment Type	Average Mutual Fund (2.08% fee)	Automated Investing (0.5% fee)
Starting Amount	$10,000	$10,000
Year 10	$56,311	$62,508
Year 20	$120,471	$147,851
Year 30	$209,265	$286,563

It's well worth paying a fee for a professionally designed investment portfolio that can be adjusted as your life changes. It's also handy to have features like automatic rebalancing — this makes sure your portfolio always contains the correct mix of assets. Some online investment platforms have a great combination of these services as well as low fees.

The last thing you want to do is overpay fees. If you are paying 1-2% in fees, you could lose up to 40% of your expected investment returns over time. Because fees are so consequential, you should make sure that you aren't overpaying for the service you are getting.

Consider how much time you can put into investing

Managing your investments can take a little time or a long time. Before you invest a dollar consider how much time you can put into managing your investments. A DIY approach will require making regular trades and ensuring sure your investments stay on track (re-balancing). A robo-advisor (automated investing) will cost a little more than doing things yourself but it won't be as time-intensive. The platform manages your investments saving you time. Christopher Liew a Certified Financial Advisor and the founder of Wealth Awesome explains this is always something to keep in mind.

""I always carefully consider how much time making an investment will take. Some investments will require much more work than others, and I don't want to spend too much of my precious time on investing.""

Make an investing plan and stick to it

One of the biggest reasons many investors have low returns is because they sell at the wrong time. They often base decisions on recent performance. They look at what has been doing well or not so well recently. Many investors tend to buy things that have appreciated in value and sell things that have declined in value.

Rather than do this, you should create a plan you will think will help you reach your goals over the time period you have to invest. Don't stop investing because of bad performance. Stick to your plan without buying or selling based on your opinion of what will happen in the near future.

Types of investments
There are many different types of investments including real estate, bonds, stocks and automated investments.

Investment	What it is	How to invest
Bonds	A loan (kind of like an IOU) with interest. They are often issued by governments. Interest rates normally exceed the interest rate of banks however you do assume more risk than a standard savings account. You have all your eggs in one basket if you only invest in bonds.	They can be purchased directly through the government, or a brokerage or trading platform. They are often included in managed portfolios too. Learn more here.
Stocks	A tiny piece of a company that anyone can buy. Stocks are volitile and while you could make a lot you could also lose a lot. When you pick individual stocks you lack diversification.	Through a broker or automated investing platform. Stocks are oftern a large part of managed portfolios. Learn more here.
Real Estate	Involves purchasing real estate such as apartments or houses. There can be a high barrier to entry as property is expensive. Real Estate Trusts allow you to invest in a sliver of property.	Directly from a property owner. Real Estate Investment Trusts can be purchased through a broker. Managed investment portfolios often contain some real estate.
Automated Investing	The hands-free approach to investing. Automated investing allows you to invest in a broad section of the market. It's advantagious as it comes with diversification and low account minimums.	Get started here.
Basics of investing in stocks
Now that you have some quick investing tips — it's time to learn the basics of investing in stocks. Chances are, at some family get-together, a drunk uncle informed you that the stock market is “rigged.” Of course, that's not true.

Investing in Stocks
Investing in stocks online could not be easier. One of the simplest and probably the cheapest way is to use an online investment platform. It takes a matter of minutes to sign up. You just need basic details like your address, phone number, and social insurance number. Automated investing offers low fees and a customized portfolio.

Risk vs. reward

The stock market is premised on the fact that investors will only invest if they’re compensated for taking the risk of buying stock. Think about it. Nobody would invest in any stock that they expected to rise 1.5% annually. You could potentially get the same or better returns from something like a smart savings investment account to any number of other investments that don’t carry as much risk as stocks do. They’d be insane to take more risk in order to collect an identical return.

One way of looking at the risk vs. reward tradeoff is through a concept known as the “equity risk premium” (ERP). This is an estimate of the expected return you gain from stocks. The percentage you can expect to earn on a stock over the so-called “risk-free rate,” the current interest rate you could get by putting your money in almost zero-risk government bonds. Without the potential for robust gains, all stocks would head straight to the basement.

Stock picking

You’d be mistaken if you thought that picking one stock is the way to benefit from this phenomenon. Warren Buffett, who will probably be remembered in history books as the world’s best stock picker, consistently advises anyone who’ll listen not to try to pick individual stocks, but rather diversify in order to benefit from the growth of the broader market. Once quoth Buffett, the Omaha oracle:

The goal of the non-professional should not be to pick winners — neither he nor his 'helpers' can do that — but should rather be to own a cross-section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well.

Why probably won't you win picking stocks? You may be very smart, but when you buy a stock at a particular price, you’re buying it from someone who also may be very smart and has access to all the same information that you do. You're betting it goes up while she’s betting it goes down. Are you really so sure you’re smarter than she is? Stock picking is exceedingly difficult and those who do it should be prepared to lose a big percentage of their investment.

Start investing in stocks with Wealthsimple and enjoy low fees and no account minimum.
Diversification

If what we told you about diversification has resonated, you'll probably want to invest in real estate, bonds, and a number of stocks. This is one way of spreading out your risk.

Let's say you decide Netflix stock will give you the best return over time. And if history is any judge, it might. But what if Amazon figures out a way to eat Netflix’s lunch? What if tastes change, and people decide they’d rather watch YouTube videos of funny cats instead of expensive dramas? The stock would be toast, and so would your investment.

For this reason, you should not only diversify your investment by investing in many stocks, but many different stock sectors (as well as bonds, real estate and other things).


This means that if one single sector suffers a big setback, it won’t drown your entire portfolio. In the dotcom crash of 2000 many tech stock prices plummeted. Had you invested everything you had in tech companies you would have made a very big loss.

Investing in stocks via ETFs

The most effective way to diversify a portfolio is by investing in mutual funds or ETFs that act as a wrapper for hundreds of different stocks or bonds; many of these will mirror the composition of well-known indices like the S&P 500. You can find a number of investment providers that allow you to invest your money in market tracking index ETFs.

Investors not only need to consider diversification, they must also consider what their investments are costing them. “Fees” they’re called, and they’re like the termites of investing — always eating and never satisfied. Actively managed mutual funds have what’s called a management expense ratio, or MER, which is the percentage of the entire fund that the mutual fund company assesses annually to pay its managers, support staff, for advertising, rent, and about anything else you could think of.

In the U.S., a 1% MER is not uncommon, and it’s more likely to be closer to 2% in Canada. Whether the fund value increases by 15% or loses 5% over the course of a year, that percentage will always be lopped right off the top.

Though it might not even sound like that much, this financial advisor demonstrated how a mere 2% MER could decrease investment gains by half over a 25-year investment. But surely these fund managers must be so great at picking stocks that their fees are justified? Au contraire! Recent research reveals that over a 15 year period, 82.2% of managed stock funds have been bested by the overall market. For this reason, many investors have jettisoned the old mutual fund strategies of their parents in favor of low-fee, passive ETFs that seek to mirror the market rather than beat it, since MERs of passive investments are generally a fraction of those of actively managed funds.

Real estate investing basics
There’s an entire genre of TV shows that make it appear as though buying and flipping real estate is the modern equivalent of alchemy. You'd think just about everyone has the amazing ability to turn drywall and vinyl siding into gold. Those who buy property hoping to get rich quick should understand the dangers.

Real estate is a business that comes with huge, expensive complications, ones that can potentially ruin unsavvy speculators. Any back of the envelope calculation of investment return must take into account expenses such as property taxes, insurance, and maintenance.

Canadian business guru Joe Canavan, founder of GT Global (Canada) and Synergy Asset Management, looked at the numbers and realized, that over the last 25 years, the S&P TSX Composite Index was up by about 325%, while during that same period, the average home price across Canada increased about 200%. That said, buying a house has been for generations a kind of forced saving plan for undisciplined investors; it might not be the absolute best investment, but without that monthly mortgage payment, they might not have saved anything at all.

Those seeking diversification in their portfolio in addition to stocks and bonds can invest in real estate without any of the headaches that come with actually owning a house or apartment. Real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are companies that sell shares in their various real estate investments. Just as diversification is important in stock holdings, REIT investors can spread their risk among dozens — or even hundreds — of REITs through REIT ETFs, of which there are literally hundreds to choose from. REITs also offer some major tax benefits that neither home ownership, nor investments in stocks or bonds, offer.

128,Not Misleading,"Investing involves putting your money to work through the buying and holding of investment products with the expectation of growing your money. It could boost your returns or provide the required amount of income to help achieve your financial goals. In many cases, the growth and income that can come from investing is a key ingredient to making financial goals achievable.

Why investing matters
Investing helps build wealth

Savings accounts can be an ideal option if you have shorter-term goals or are looking to build an emergency fund, as they offer security and liquidity but typically have lower rates of return than investing products. However, if you have longer-term goals, like saving for retirement or a child's education, buying investments may be a better option, as these products are designed to be held over a longer time frame and can give you the chance to earn a higher potential rate of return. Over the long run, even a small but positive difference in your rate of return can have a big impact on whether you achieve your goals.

Your personal investment strategy should be based on your financial goals. For example, if you're saving for a short-term purchase, a secure bank savings account can serve you well. But if you have long-range goals, consider the potential of compound investing through a market-based GIC or Mutual Fund. Learn the differences and details in this interactive video.

This video shows the difference between Mutual Funds versus GICs
The power of compound growth
Compounding is a powerful process in which an investment’s earnings are reinvested to generate additional earnings and growth over time. This can make a significant difference in growing your investment over the long term. The sooner you start investing, the sooner you could benefit from the power of compounding.

Use our compound interest calculator to see how your investment could grow over time.

One of the most effective ways to benefit from the power of compounding is to start early and invest automatically. Setting up a pre-authorized payment plan allows you to regularly contribute to a TD Mutual Fund from your TD chequing account on a weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis. By starting to invest regularly, you could be pleasantly surprised by how much your money will grow over time.

Investing may help you outpace inflation
Inflation is the rise in the price of goods and services resulting in a substantial and continuing drop in purchasing power over a period of time. A high rate of inflation means prices are increasing quickly and your money may not buy as much in the future as it does today. In order to grow your money over the long run, you'll need to earn a return that exceeds the rate of inflation after tax. For example: with 2% per year inflation and a 35% marginal tax rate, you would need to earn a return of 3.08% per year in order for your investment to have as much purchasing power in the future as it does today1. One way you may be able to outpace inflation is through investing your money. Depending on the investment product selected investing can have a higher risk when compared to putting your money in a savings account but could also bring about higher returns.

What to consider before investing?
Think about your financial situation
Understanding your financial situation is key to building a successful investment strategy. Before you invest, remember to consider your:

Budget: Building a budget will help you understand how much money you earn, spend and save. A budget can help you determine what you are spending your money on to better help you make decisions on how much you have available to save or invest.

Financial goals: Assess what your goals are and how much money you will need to achieve your goals. An example could be understanding how much money you need to save for retirement. Our TD Retirement Savings Calculator can help you see what you'll need to retire the way you want.

Investment objectives: Are you looking to grow your money, to generate an income or to keep your original investment safe? There are a range of investment products that are suitable to help meet your objectives.

Time horizon: Markets move up and down. If you’re investing your money and need to use it in the near term, you could be negatively impacted during a market downturn if you have to sell your investment at a loss. It is important to choose investment products that align with your time horizon to help ensure you can weather downturns and be able to benefit when markets improve again.

Risk profile: Risk tolerance is the ability to handle fluctuations in the value of your investments. Ideally, you should invest in products that you feel comfortable holding, even when faced with market fluctuations.

All these factors can change over time. It's important to review these considerations as your circumstances change or at a minimum of annually once you start investing to ensure you continue to hold investments that meet your needs. A TD Personal Banker can work with you to conduct a goals-based review of your options and to help determine which investments are suitable for you.

Common types of registered plans and investments
How do registered plans work?
Registered plans were created by the federal government and are designed to encourage Canadians to save money by offering special tax benefits, which could allow you to grow your money faster. Registered plans have specific rules, regulations and eligibility criteria. Once a registered plan is opened, customers can hold various qualified investments within the plan (depending on what products are offered by the financial institution) like mutual funds, GICs, ETFs, stocks or bonds. Depending on the type of investments held within the plan, the rate of return may be determined by the performance of the investments. There are many different types of registered plans and most Canadians would benefit by choosing to invest within one, if they qualify. For more information, explore our registered plan options.

Registered Plans
TFSA: A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is a registered plan where you can save or invest up to your individual contribution limit and your earnings are tax-free.

RRSP: A Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) is a registered plan that lets you build up savings designed for your retirement, while deferring your taxes.

RESP: A Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) is a registered plan that helps you save for a child’s post-secondary education. RESPs can be a great option as saving incentives, such as grants, are offered by government.

RDSP: A Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) is a special program for Canadians with disabilities and their families to help save for long-term financial needs like future medical costs.

RRIF: A Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) is a retirement income option which gives you the flexibility of deciding how much income you withdraw each year from your retirement savings. You have to be paid a minimum annual amount from your RRIF account according to the federal government’s predetermined schedule. Often, owners of RRSPs roll over the balance from those plans into a RRIF.

Investing Products
Mutual Fund: A mutual fund is an investment that pools the money of many individual investors and uses it to buy securities such as bonds, stocks, or other investable assets that are selected and managed by a fund manager. Each mutual fund has an investment objective which the fund seeks to achieve to the benefit of the investor. You invest in mutual funds by purchasing units of the fund. Mutual fund values tend to fluctuate and there is no guarantee that you will earn a return on your investment or the total amount you invested will be returned to you. It is recommended that you review the fund facts or prospectus before investing in mutual funds.

GICs: A Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) is a deposit which provides a guaranteed rate of return on your investment and secures your principle investment amount, making it a safe way to invest your money.

Stocks: Stocks are units of ownership of a corporation. Owning stock in a company entitles the owner to an equal share of earnings that are paid out, if any, in the form of dividends. Holding stocks means having part ownership of a company. The terms 'share' and 'stock' are often used interchangeably.

Bonds: Bonds are debt instruments (financial assets that can be traded) that promise to pay a specified amount of interest and to return the principle amount on a specified maturity date. Bonds are issued by federal, provincial and municipal governments, as well as corporations.

ETFs: Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are pooled investments like mutual funds. ETFs often are structured to mirror a stock index, but unlike mutual funds, they are bought and sold on a stock exchange.

Investing terms and concepts
Even if you're new to investing, it's important to know the basic terms and concepts. This will help you better understand what investment options could be right for you.

Return: Also known as rate of return, this is the amount your investment has changed in value over a specific period of time. It's usually shown as a percentage of your original investment or principle.

Risk: In investing, risk is the chance you might lose some or all of the money you've invested. Many investments offer the potential for a higher rate of return but also involve some level of risk. Your comfort with risk generally depends on your willingness to accept fluctuations in the value of your investments, and your ability to weather any potential for financial loss. This is known as your risk tolerance.

While risk can't be completely removed, investment options like mutual funds, can align to different customer objectives and risk tolerances. Very low risk investments like GICs that offer principle protection provide safety but offer a lower potential for return.

Liquidity: Liquidity refers to the availability of your money. The more liquid it is, the more available it is. Liquid assets or investments are those you are able to cash in or sell quickly, like savings accounts and most stocks. Liquidity can be important if you are planning to use your savings or investments in the short term.

Diversification: Having a wide mix of investments is called diversification. It can help to reduce your risk because some investments will do better at certain times, when others do not.

Dollar Cost Averaging: Dollar-cost averaging is the investment strategy of gradually buying at regular intervals over a period of months or years. In situations where the value of the investment fluctuates, investing automatically/regularly helps to even out the purchases over time, and may improve the growth potential of investments in the long run, reduce the risk, and take the worry out of 'when to invest' to maximize returns.

Principle: In investing, the principle is the initial amount of money you put into your investment.

129,Not Misleading,"There are a lot of ways to save your hard-earned money and accomplish your financial goals. If you want your money to have the possibility of growing over time, you may want to consider investing your savings. Not familiar with investing? Don’t be intimidated, it’s not as complicated as it sounds. If you want to learn, grab a cup of coffee and keep reading. We’ll help you understand the basics of investing including investment concepts, strategies, and personal factors to consider when making investment decisions.

Investment options:
There are many vehicles to invest your money in and many strategies for how to choose which ones are right for you. The approach you take will depend on your personal situation, including factors such as your goals, risk tolerance (comfort with changes in the market) and time-horizon (length of time you plan to invest).

 

Basic investment vehicles:
Purchasing stocks or bonds are two common ways to invest. You can also purchase mutual funds, which pool your money with that of other investors and invest it in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or another vehicle, or some combination thereof. Stocks are generally considered more risky investments than bonds and because mutual funds are a combination of investments they offer more diversification.

Stocks
A stock represents a piece of ownership or equity in a company, so a person who owns stock (stockholder or shareholder) owns a piece of the company.
Stocks are considered the riskiest investment of the options listed here. Nevertheless, it’s worth noting even within this relatively risky investment class, some stocks are considered safer than others (though the potential for loss always exists).
As a company’s stock goes up in value, so does your piece of the pie, and vice versa when the value of a share goes down.
Some types of stock offer dividends, which is a regular payment made to shareholders. It’s important to note that there are many different types of stock, all with different characteristics. Before you invest, make sure you fully understand what type of stock you’re purchasing and all the risks associated with it.
Bonds
Purchasing a bond is essentially loaning your money to a corporation, city, organization or government for a fixed period of time and in return they’ll pay you some amount of interest.
The borrower issues a bond with the terms of the loan, including the amount and schedule of interest payments and the date on which the principal (the initial amount invested) must be paid back (the maturity date).
The value of a bond rises and falls with market interest rates, so it is possible to lose money when selling a bond.
Bonds are generally considered a less risky investment than stocks.
There are many different types of bonds, all of which work differently. Before you invest, make sure you fully understand what type of bond you’re purchasing and all the terms that come with it.
Mutual Funds
A mutual fund is a professionally managed collection of investments – generally stocks and/or bonds. This collection of investments is chosen by a fund manager. Investors can purchase one or many shares of a mutual fund.
Because the risk is spread out over many investments, mutual funds are generally considered less risky than an investment in a single stock.
Understanding interest
Much like bonds earn interest, you will find that some savings accounts offer the benefit of earning a small amount of interest on your money. Although it’s technically not invested, depositing money into a savings account is like lending money to a financial institution. A financial institution may pay you interest on the money you have deposited there, so that you can earn a small percentage on your savings over time. The amount of interest paid and how often it gets paid is primarily based on the type of account. Depending on the type of account and terms, interest may also compound over time. Compounding interest lets you earn interest not only on your original deposit, but also on any interest you earn on that deposit. It means your original deposit grows much, much faster than it would with simple interest!
 

Understanding risk
It’s important to remember that you are taking on risk with any investment, because you’re never guaranteed a positive return. While there’s always the potential to lose money (fingers crossed this isn’t the case), risk varies with investment type and if you are careful in spreading out your risk, you can minimize your chances of loss. A strategy many investors use to spread out their risk is called diversification. Diversification is an investment strategy where you choose many different investment types to balance out your exposure to risk – pairing investments that are risky with those that are not-as-risky, so you are more protected overall. Diversifying your portfolio is essentially making sure you don’t “put all your eggs in one basket.” Cliché, but true!
 

Building an investment portfolio
So, just how should you go about investing and putting an appropriate strategy in place? There are so many investment options and things to consider regarding your personal situation that a good place to start is with consulting professional. You can talk to a financial planner to understand the risk you are comfortable taking and get advice on how to invest to meet your specific goals, both short and long term. Don’t think you have enough money to work with a professional? Many financial planners offer simple, flat fees so there’s no minimum investment required to work with them. That’s true here at John Hancock! Our team of financial planners offer flexible packages to fit your needs and your budget. Everyone starts somewhere. "
130,Not Misleading,"Investing is a time-tested way of putting your money to work for you, as you work to earn more of it. Legendary investor Warren Buffett defined investing as “forgoing consumption now in order to have the ability to consume more at a later date.”1

By investing your money regularly, you may be able to increase it many times over with time. That's why it's important to begin investing as early as possible and as soon as you have some money saved for that purpose. Furthermore, the stock market is a good place to start.

Whether you have $1,000 set aside or can manage only an extra $25 a week, you can get started. Bear in mind that there's a lot that you can and should learn about investing in stocks to achieve financial success. However, right now, read on for the steps to begin the process.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Investing is the act of committing money or capital to an endeavor with the expectation of obtaining additional income or profit.
Unlike consuming, investing puts money to work so it can grow over time.
However, investing also comes with the risk of losses.
The stock market is a common way for investors, no matter their experience, to invest for a lifetime.
Beginning investors can get help from expert advisors, leave their portfolio selection and management to robo-advisors, or take a DIY approach to investing in stocks,
Click Play to Learn How to Start Investing in Stocks
Steps to Get Started
1. Define Your Tolerance for Risk
What's your tolerance for risk (the chance that you may lose money while investing)? Stocks are categorized in various ways, such as large capitalization stocks, small cap stocks, aggressive growth stocks, and value stocks. They all have different levels of risk. Once you determine your risk tolerance, you can set your investment sights on the stocks that complement it.

2. Decide on Your Investment Goals
You should also determine your investment goals. When opening a brokerage account, an online broker such as Charles Schwab or Fidelity will ask you about your investment goals (and the aforementioned level of risk that you’re willing to take).

If you're just beginning your career, an investment goal could be to increase the amount of money in your account. If you're older, you may want to generate income as well as grow and protect your wealth.
Your investment goals might include buying a house, funding your retirement, or saving for tuition. Goals can change over time. Just make sure that you define and review them periodically so that you can keep your focus on achieving them.
3. Determine Your Investing Style
Some investors want to take an active hand in managing their investments, while others prefer to set it and forget it. Your preference may change, but decide on an approach to get started.

If you're confident about your investing knowledge and capability, you could manage your investing and portfolio on your own. Traditional online brokers, like the two mentioned above, allow you to invest in stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), index funds, and mutual funds. 
An experienced broker or financial advisor can help you make your investment decisions, monitor your portfolio, and make changes to it. This is a good option for beginners who understand the importance of investing but may want an expert to help them do it.
A robo-advisor is an automated, hands-off option that typically costs less than working with a broker or financial advisor. Once a robo-advisor program has your goals, risk tolerance level, and other details, it automatically invests for you.
4. Choose Your Investment Account
Retirement plan at work: You can invest in various stock and bond mutual funds and target-date funds through a retirement plan at work, such as a 401(k), if your employer offers one. It may also offer the option of investing in the employer's company stock.

Once you enroll in a plan, contributions are made automatically at a level you set. Employers may make matching contributions on your behalf. Your contributions are tax deductible and your account balance grows tax deferred. This is a great way to maximize your investing dollars with little effort. It can also instill in investors the discipline of regular investing.

An IRA or taxable account at a brokerage: You can also start investing in stocks by opening an individual retirement account (even in addition to having a workplace plan). Or, you can go with a regular, taxable brokerage account. Normally, you'll have lots of options for investing in stocks. These could include individual stocks, stock mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs), stock options.

A robo-advisor account: As referenced above, this type of account takes your investment goals and creates a stock portfolio for you.

5. Learn to Diversify and Reduce Risk
Diversification is an important investment concept to understand. In a nutshell, by investing in a range of assets, or diversifying, you reduce the risk that one investment’s performance can severely hurt the return of your overall investment portfolio. You could think of it as financial jargon for not putting all of your eggs in one basket.

It can be difficult to diversify when investing in individual stocks if your budget is limited. For example, with just $1,000, you may only be able to invest in one or two companies. This results in greater risk.

This is where mutual funds and ETFs can help. Both types of funds tend to own a large number of stocks and other investments. This makes them a more diversified option than a single stock.

Minimums to Open an Account
Many financial institutions have minimum deposit requirements. In other words, they won’t accept your account application unless you deposit a certain amount of money.

It pays to shop around, and not just to find out minimum deposits. Check out our broker reviews (see below). Some firms don't require minimum deposits. Others may reduce costs, such as trading fees and account management fees if you have a balance above a certain threshold. Still others may offer a certain number of commission-free trades for opening an account.

The Costs to Invest in Stocks
Commissions and Fees
As economists like to say, there's no free lunch. All brokers have to make money from their customers in one way or another.

In most cases, your broker will charge a commission every time that you trade stocks, whether you buy or sell. Trading fees range from $2 per trade to as high as $10. Some brokers charge no trade commissions at all, but they make up for it with other fees.

Depending on how often you trade, these fees can add up, affect your portfolio's return, and deplete the amount of money you have to invest.

Here's an example:

Imagine that you decide to buy one share of stock in each of five companies with your $1,000. Assuming a transaction fee of $10, you will incur $50 in trading costs which is equivalent to five percent of your $1,000.

Should you sell these stocks, the round trip (the act of buying and then selling) would cost you a total of $100, or 10 percent of your initial deposit amount of $1,000. These costs alone can eat into your account balance before your investments even have a chance to earn a positive return.

Mutual Fund Loads
Mutual funds are professionally managed pools of investor funds that focus their investments in different markets.

They have various fees that you should be aware of. One of these is the management expense ratio (MER). The MER is the fee paid by shareholders of a mutual fund (or ETF) and goes toward the expenses of running a fund.

It’s based on the total of a fund's assets under management. The MER can range from 0.05 percent to 2 percent annually. Bear in mind that, the higher the MER, the more it impacts the fund's overall return.

You may also see sales charges called loads. These include front-end loads and back-end loads. Be sure you understand whether a fund carries a sales load prior to buying it. Check out your broker's list of no-load funds and no-transaction-fee funds to avoid these charges.

For the beginning investor, mutual fund fees may be more palatable compared to the commissions charged when you buy individual stocks. Plus, you can invest less to get started with a fund than you’d probably pay to invest in individual stocks.

By the way, investing small amounts consistently over time in a mutual fund can give you the benefits of dollar cost averaging (DCA) by reducing the impact of volatility. 

Online Brokers
Brokers are either full-service or discount.

Full-Service Brokers
Full-service brokers, as the name implies, offer a full range of traditional brokerage services, including financial advice for college planning, retirement planning, estate planning, and for other life events and opportunities. This custom-tailored advice justifies the higher fees that they typically charge, compared to other brokers. These can include a percentage of your transactions, a percentage of your assets under management, and sometimes, a yearly membership fee. Minimum account sizes can start at $25,000. 

Discount Brokers
Discount brokers used to be the exception but are now the norm. They offer you tools to select your investments and place your orders. Some also offer a set-it-and-forget-it robo-advisory service (more below). Many provide educational materials on their sites and mobile apps, which can be helpful for beginning investors.

Some brokers have no (or very low) minimum deposit restrictions. However, they may have other requirements and fees. Be sure to check on both of these as you look for a brokerage account that meets your stock investing needs.

Robo-Advisors
After the 2008 financial crisis, a new breed of investment advisor was born: the robo-advisor. Jon Stein and Eli Broverman of Betterment are often credited as the first in the space.23 Their mission was to use technology to lower costs for investors and streamline investment advice.

Since Betterment launched, other robo-first companies have been founded. Established online brokers such as Charles Schwab have added robo-like advisory services. According to a report by Charles Schwab, 58% of Americans say they will use some sort of robo-advice by 2025.4

If you want an algorithm to make investment decisions for you, including for tax-loss harvesting and rebalancing, a robo-advisor may be for you. What's more, the success of index investing has shown that if your goal is long-term wealth building, a robo-advisor may fit your style.

Stock Market Simulators
People new to investing who wish to gain experience investing without risking their money in the process may find that a stock market simulator is a valuable tool. There are a wide variety of trading simulators available, including those with and without fees. Investopedia's simulator is entirely free to use.

Stock market simulators offer users imaginary, virtual money to invest in a portfolio of stocks, options, ETFs, or other securities. These simulators typically track price movements of investments and, depending on the simulator, other notable considerations such as trading fees or dividend payouts.

Investors make virtual trades as if they were investing with real money. Through this process, simulator users have the opportunity to learn about investing—and to experience the consequences of their virtual investment decisions—without putting their own money on the line. Some simulators even allow users to compete against other participants, providing an additional incentive to invest thoughtfully.

What Is the Difference Between a Full-Service and a Discount Broker?
Full-service brokers provide a broad array of financial services, including financial advice for retirement, healthcare, education, and more. They can also offer a host of investment products and educational resources. They have traditionally catered to high-net-worth individuals and often require significant investments. Discount brokers have much lower thresholds for access, but tend to offer a more streamlined set of services. Discount brokers allow users to place individual trades. They also offer educational tools.

What Are the Risks of Investing?
Investing is a commitment of resources now toward a future financial goal. There are many levels of risk, with certain asset classes and investment products inherently much riskier than others. All investing comes with some degree of risk. It is always possible that the value of your investment will not increase over time. For this reason, a key consideration for investors is how to manage their risk in order to achieve their financial goals, whether these goals are short- or long-term.

How Do Commissions and Fees Work?
Most brokers charge customers a commission for every trade. These fees can go up to about $10 per trade. Due to commission costs, investors generally find it prudent to limit the total number of trades that they make to avoid spending extra money on fees. Certain other types of investments, such as exchange-traded funds, carry fees in order to cover the costs of fund management.

The Bottom Line
If you're just starting out as an investor, it's possible to invest in stocks with a relatively small amount of money. You'll have to do your homework to determine your investment goals, your risk tolerance, and the costs associated with investing in stocks and mutual funds. You should also investigate various brokers to clarify the particular requirements of each and which may best fit your needs.

Once you do, you’ll be well positioned to take advantage of the substantial potential that stocks have to reward you financially throughout the years.
Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk. Before trading options, please read Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options. Supporting documentation for any claims, if applicable, will be furnished upon request.

There is an Options Regulatory Fee that applies to both option buy and sell transactions. The fee is subject to change. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details."
131,Not Misleading,"Investing is the simple act of putting money into a financial asset with the goal of generating an income, making a profit or both. A financial asset is anything that has the ability to make money – think shares, property or term deposits.

Understanding the basics of investing is the first step in your wealth-creation journey. But actually putting those basics into practice is what will help you to create wealth over time, so it pays to start early.

“Investing aims to ensure our long-term financial security. This is important because investing is something that takes time. Patience is required to achieve financial success,” says Peter Rambert, Senior Financial Adviser at Australian Unity.

Types of investments
What you choose to invest in will depend on your personal requirements and goals, but investments generally fall into two main categories: those that generate or make a profit, and those that generate an income.

Many people hold both types of investments, which allows them to develop a diversified portfolio of assets.

Investments that generate growth or make a profit
Shares (also known as stocks) in companies, infrastructure (which includes roads, tollways, airports and railways) and property-based investments are all examples of investments that generate growth or a profit. You can also invest in managed funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs).

“With these types of assets, there is a risk that the value of your investments can go up or down in value. They tend to have less stable income returns because the predominant goal is to make a profit,” says Peter.

Investments that generate an income
Investments that produce an income include cash and term deposits, as well as bonds, which are investments that allow you to lend money to a company or government with the purpose of receiving a regular and predictable rate of return. These investments are also known as defensive assets

“The regularity of the return is what makes an investment defensive,” explains Peter.

As an example, let’s say you invest in a term deposit for six months. You can be certain you will get your money back, as well as a pre-determined amount of interest over the life of the investment.



Where to start
If you’re interested in investing, you’ll need to do some research. A great place to start is the government’s Moneysmart website, an education resource providing practical information on all types of investing, as well as tools such as calculators that help you to work out how much wealth you could build over time.

Next it’s important to work out your investment goals, although these will depend on the individual or couple. The goal for some investors will be to save for their retirement or child’s education. Others will want to save for more short-term objectives such as a holiday or a wedding. Or you can aim for a combination of goals.

“Understanding what you are trying to achieve is really important. This will help to determine how much money should be allocated between growth and defensive investments,” says Peter.

Your stage of life will also determine your approach to investing. This includes whether you have or plan on having a family, lifestyle goals such as a desire to travel, how much you earn and how much money you want to have to retire comfortably.

Avoiding common mistakes
Everyone has an opinion on finances and it can be easy to get swept along with what other people are doing – especially if you feel they are successful in their approach.

“There's an old adage,” says Peter. “If your taxi driver tells you what to invest in, you probably should be getting out of investing. It involves a lot more science than just following the herd.”

Peter adds that it’s important to get proper financial advice, rather than simply making decisions based on how your friends or workmates invest. Investing takes discipline and time. Building a relationship with an experienced, qualified financial adviser is a great way to help you set your investment goals, decide what to invest in, and manage and monitor your assets over time.

Another common mistake to avoid is getting emotional about your investments. “If you're either overconfident or anxious about an investment, you probably shouldn't be investing,” he adds. A measured approach goes a long way.

Just do it
Above all, says Peter, the idea is to just get started. “Make a decision and do something about it. You don’t have to invest much, you just need to start. That’s the best way to set you on to a path of financial security. Start small and build up over time. You’re unlikely to get wealthy overnight, but with education, experience and, of course, advice, you'll get there.”

Investing doesn’t need to be daunting – as Peter said, start small if you don’t feel confident at first. But if you take the time to understand the basic concepts, the different types of investments and figure out your goals, you’ll be well on your way to achieving wealth.

"
132,Not Misleading,"If you’re not well-versed in the basics of the stock market, the stock trading information spewing from the media can border on gibberish.

Phrases such as “earnings movers” and “intraday highs” don’t mean much to the average investor, and in many cases, they shouldn’t. If you’re in it for the long term — with, say, a 401(k) account geared toward retirement — you don’t need to worry about what these words mean. You can get by just fine without understanding the stock market much at all, as long as you figure out how much you need to invest for retirement.

If, on the other hand, you want to learn how to trade stocks, you do need to understand the stock market, and at least some basic information about how stock trading works.

Stock market basics
The stock market is made up of exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Stocks are listed on a specific exchange, which brings buyers and sellers together and acts as a market for the shares of those stocks. The exchange tracks the supply and demand — and directly related, the price — of each stock.

When you go to invest in the stock market you're purchasing stocks that are listed on those exchanges. You're not purchasing the stock market itself.

Individual traders are typically represented by brokers — these days, that’s often an online broker. You place your stock trades through the broker, which then deals with the exchange on your behalf.

The NYSE and the Nasdaq are open from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern. If those hours don't work for you, some brokers do offer premarket and after-hours trading sessions.

Understanding the stock market
When people refer to the stock market being up or down, they’re generally referring to one of the major market indexes.

A market index tracks the performance of a group of stocks, which either represents the market as a whole or a specific sector of the market, like technology or retail companies. You’re likely to hear most about the S&P 500, the Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; they are often used as proxies for the performance of the overall market.

Investors use indexes to benchmark the performance of their own portfolios and, in some cases, to inform their stock trading decisions. You can also invest in an entire index through an index fund or exchange-traded fund, or ETF, which usually tracks a specific index or sector of the market.

Stock trading information
Record-high inflation and stock market volatility related to war, supply-chain issues, and rising interest rates can unsettle even the most experienced investors. And most investors would be well-advised to build a diversified portfolio of stocks or stock index funds and hold onto it through good times and bad.

But investors who like a little more action engage in stock trading. Stock trading involves buying and selling stocks frequently in an attempt to time the market.

The goal of stock traders is to capitalize on short-term market events to sell stocks for a profit, or buy stocks at a low. Some stock traders are day traders, which means they buy and sell several times throughout the day. Others are simply active traders, placing a dozen or more trades per month.

Investors who trade stocks do extensive research, often devoting hours a day to following the market. They rely on technical stock analysis, using tools to chart a stock's movements in an attempt to find trading opportunities and trends. Many online brokers offer stock trading information, including analyst reports, stock research and charting tools. (Learn the basics of how to read stock charts.)

Bull markets vs. bear markets
Neither is an animal you’d want to run into on a hike, but the market has picked the bear as the true symbol of fear: A bear market means stock prices are falling — thresholds vary, but generally to the tune of 20% or more — across several of the indexes referenced earlier.

Bull markets are followed by bear markets, and vice versa, with both often signaling the start of larger economic patterns. In other words, a bull market typically means investors are confident, which indicates economic growth. A bear market shows investors are pulling back, indicating the economy may do so as well.

The good news is that the average bull market far outlasts the average bear market, which is why over the long term you can grow your money by investing in stocks.

The S&P 500, which holds about 500 of the largest stocks in the U.S., entered bear market territory June 13, 2022. It has recovered somewhat, but is still down more than 15% over the last year.

But the index has historically returned an average of about 7% annually, when you factor in reinvested dividends and adjust for inflation. That means if you invested $1,000 30 years ago, you could have about $7,600 today. (Explore this further with NerdWallet's investment calculator.)

Stock market crash vs. correction
A stock market correction happens when the stock market drops by 10% or more. A stock market crash is a sudden, very sharp drop in stock prices, like in early 2020, around the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

While crashes can herald a bear market, remember what we mentioned above: Most bull markets last longer than bear markets — which means stock markets tend to rise in value over time. In 2020, the market was back to hitting record highs by August.

If you're worried about a crash, it helps to focus on the long term. When the stock market declines, it can be difficult to watch your portfolio’s value shrink in real time and do nothing about it. However, if you’re investing for the long term, doing nothing is often the best course.

Why? Because when you sell investments in a downturn, you lock in your losses. If you plan to re-enter the market at a sunnier time, you’ll almost certainly pay more for the privilege and sacrifice part (if not all) of the gains from the rebound.

The importance of diversification
You can’t avoid bear markets as an investor. What you can avoid is the risk that comes from an undiversified portfolio.

Diversification helps protect your portfolio from inevitable market setbacks. If you throw all of your money into one company, you’re banking on success that can quickly be halted by regulatory issues, poor leadership or an E. coli outbreak.

To smooth out that company-specific risk, investors diversify by pooling multiple types of stocks together, balancing out the inevitable losers and eliminating the risk that one company’s contaminated beef will wipe out your entire portfolio.

But building a diversified portfolio of individual stocks takes a lot of time, patience and research. The alternative is a mutual fund, the aforementioned exchange-traded fund or an index fund. These hold a basket of investments, so you’re automatically diversified. An S&P 500 index fund, for example, would aim to mirror the performance of the S&P 500 by investing in the 500 companies in that index.

The good news is you can combine individual stocks and funds in a single portfolio. One suggestion: Dedicate 10% or less of your portfolio to selecting a few stocks you believe in, and put the rest into index funds."
133,Not Misleading,"tocks, which are also called equities, are securities that give shareholders an ownership interest in a public company. It’s a real stake in the business, and if you own all the shares of the business, you control how the business operates. The stock market refers to the collection of stocks that can be bought and sold by the general public on a variety of different exchanges.

Where does stock come from? Public companies issue stock so that they can fund their businesses. Investors who think the business will prosper in the future buy those stock issues. The shareholders get any dividends plus any appreciation in the price of the shares. They can also watch their investment shrink or disappear entirely if the company runs out of money.

The stock market is really a kind of aftermarket, where people who own shares in the company can sell them to investors who want to buy them. This trading takes place on a stock exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. In years past, traders used to go to a physical location — the exchange’s floor — to trade, but now virtually all trading takes place electronically.

When news people say, “the market was up today,” typically they are referring to the performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The S&P 500 is made up of around 500 large publicly traded companies in the U.S, while the Dow includes 30 large companies. These track the performance of the collections of stock and show how they fared on that day of trading and over time.

However, even though people are referring to the Dow and the S&P 500 as “the market,” those are really indexes of stocks. These indexes represent some of the largest companies in the U.S., but they are not the total market, which includes thousands of publicly traded companies.

Of course, you’ll need a brokerage account before you start investing in stocks. As you’re getting started, here are eight more guidelines for investing in the stock market.

How to invest in the stock market: 9 tips for beginners
Buy the right investment
Avoid individual stocks if you’re a beginner
Create a diversified portfolio
Be prepared for a downturn
Try a simulator before investing real money
Stay committed to your long-term portfolio
Start now
Avoid short-term trading
Keep investing over time
1. Buy the right investment
Buying the right stock is so much easier said than done. Anyone can see a stock that’s performed well in the past, but anticipating the performance of a stock in the future is much more difficult. If you want to succeed by investing in individual stocks, you have to be prepared to do a lot of work to analyze a company and manage the investment.

“When you start looking at statistics you’ve got to remember that the professionals are looking at each and every one of those companies with much more rigor than you can probably do as an individual, so it’s a very difficult game for the individual to win over time,” says Dan Keady, CFP, chief financial planning strategist at TIAA.

If you’re analyzing a company, you’ll want to look at a company’s fundamentals – earnings per share (EPS) or a price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), for example. But you’ll have to do so much more: analyze the company’s management team, evaluate its competitive advantages, study its financials, including its balance sheet and income statement. Even these items are just the start.

Keady says going out and buying stock in your favorite product or company isn’t the right way to go about investing. Also, don’t put too much faith in past performance because it’s no guarantee of the future.

You’ll have to study the company and anticipate what’s coming next, a tough job in good times.

2. Avoid individual stocks if you’re a beginner
Everyone has heard someone talk about a big stock win or a great stock pick.

“What they forget about is that often they’re not talking about those particular investments that they also own that did very, very poorly over time,” Keady says. “So sometimes people have an unrealistic expectation about the kind of returns that they can make in the stock market. And sometimes they confuse luck with skill. You can get lucky sometimes picking an individual stock. It’s hard to be lucky over time and avoid those big downturns also.”

Remember, to make money consistently in individual stocks, you need to know something that the forward-looking market isn’t already pricing into the stock price. Keep in mind that for every seller in the market, there’s a buyer for those same shares who’s equally sure they will profit.

“There are tons of smart people doing this for a living, and if you’re a novice, the likelihood of you outperforming that is not very good,” says Tony Madsen, CFP, founder of NewLeaf Financial Guidance in Redwood Falls, Minnesota.

An alternative to individual stocks is an index fund, which can be either a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds hold dozens or even hundreds of stocks. And each share you purchase of a fund owns all the companies included in the index.

Unlike stock, mutual funds and ETFs may have annual fees, though some funds are free.

3. Create a diversified portfolio
One of the key advantages of an index fund is that you immediately have a range of stocks in the fund. For example, if you own a broadly diversified fund based on the S&P 500, you’ll own stocks in hundreds of companies across many different industries. But you could also buy a narrowly diversified fund focused on one or two industries.

Diversification is important because it reduces the risk of any one stock in the portfolio hurting the overall performance very much, and that actually improves your overall returns. In contrast, if you’re buying only one individual stock, you really do have all your eggs in one basket.

The easiest way to create a broad portfolio is by buying an ETF or a mutual fund. The products have diversification built into them, and you don’t have to do any analysis of the companies held in the index fund.

“It may not be the most exciting, but it’s a great way to start,” Keady says. “And again, it gets you out of thinking that you’re gonna be so smart, that you’re going to be able to pick the stocks that are going to go up, won’t go down and know when to get in and out of them.”

When it comes to diversification, that doesn’t just mean many different stocks. It also means investments that are spread among different industries – since stock in similar sectors may move in a similar direction for the same reason.

4. Be prepared for a downturn
The hardest issue for most investors is stomaching a loss in their investments. And because the stock market can fluctuate, you will have losses occur from time to time. You’ll have to steel yourself to handle these losses, or you’ll be apt to buy high and sell low during a panic.

As long as you diversify your portfolio, any single stock that you own shouldn’t have too much of an impact on your overall return. If it does, buying individual stocks might not be the right choice for you. Even index funds will fluctuate, so you can’t get rid of all of your risk, try how you might.

“Anytime the market changes we have this propensity to try to pull back or to second guess our willingness to be in,” says NewLeaf’s Madsen.

That’s why it’s important to prepare yourself for downturns that could come out of nowhere, as one did in 2020. You need to ride out short-term volatility to get attractive long-term returns.

In investing, you need to know that it’s possible to lose money, since stocks don’t have principal guarantees. If you’re looking for a guaranteed return, perhaps a high-yield CD might be better.

The concept of market volatility can be difficult for new and even experienced investors to understand, cautions Keady.

“One of the interesting things is people will see the market’s volatile because the market’s going down,” Keady says. “Of course, when it’s going up it’s also volatile – at least from a statistical standpoint – it’s moving all over the place. So it’s important for people to say that the volatility that they’re seeing on the upside, they’ll also see on the downside.”

5. Try a stock market simulator before investing real money
One way to enter the world of investing without taking risk is to use a stock simulator. Using an online trading account with virtual dollars won’t put your real money at risk. You’ll also be able to determine how you would react if this really were your money that you gained or lost.

“That can be really helpful because it can help people overcome the belief that they’re smarter than the market, that they can always pick the best stocks, always buy and sell in the market at the right time,” Keady says.

Asking yourself why you’re investing can help determine if investing in stocks is for you.

“If their thought is that they’re going to somehow outperform the market, pick all the best stocks, maybe it’s a good idea to try some type of simulator or watch some stocks and see if you could actually do it,” Keady says. “Then if you’re more serious about investing over time, then I think you’re much better off – almost all of us, including myself – to have a diversified portfolio such as provided by mutual funds or exchange traded funds.”

(Bankrate reviewed some of the best investing apps, including a few fun stock simulators.)

6. Stay committed to your long-term portfolio
Keady says investing should be a long-term activity. He also says you should divorce yourself from the daily news cycle.

By skipping the daily financial news, you’ll be able to develop patience, which you’ll need if you want to stay in the investing game for the long term. It’s also useful to look at your portfolio infrequently, so that you don’t become too unnerved or too elated. These are great tips for beginners who have yet to manage their emotions when investing.

“Some of the news cycle, at times it becomes 100 percent negative and it can become overwhelming for people,” Keady says.

One strategy for beginners is to set up a calendar and predetermine when you’ll be evaluating your portfolio. Sticking to this guideline will prevent you from selling out of a stock during some volatility – or not getting the full benefit of a well-performing investment, Keady says.

7. Start now
Choosing the perfect opportunity to jump in and invest in the stock market typically doesn’t work well. Nobody knows with 100 percent certainty the best time to get in. And investing is meant to be a long-term activity. There is no perfect time to start.

“One of the core points with investing is not just to think about it, but to get started,” Keady says. “And start now. Because if you invest now, and often over time, that compounding is the thing that can really drive your results. If you want to invest, it’s very important to actually get started and have … an ongoing savings program, so that we can reach our goals over time.”

8. Avoid short-term trading
Understanding whether you’re investing for the long-term future or the short term can also help determine your strategy – and whether you should be investing at all. Sometimes short-term investors can have unrealistic expectations about growing their money. And research shows that most short-term investors, such as day traders, lose money. You’re competing against high-powered investors and well-programmed computers that may better understand the market.

New investors need to be aware that buying and selling stocks frequently can get expensive. It can create taxes and other fees, even if a broker’s headline trading commission is zero.

If you’re investing for the short term, you risk not having your money when you need it.

“When I’m advising clients … anything under a couple of years, even sometimes three years out, I’m hesitant to take too much market risk with those dollars,” Madsen says.

Depending on your financial goals, a savings account, money market account or a short-term CD may be better options for short-term money. Experts often advise investors that they should invest in the stock market only if they can keep the money invested for at least three to five years. Money that you need for a specific purpose in the next couple years should probably be invested in low-risk investments, such as a high-yield savings account or a high-yield CD.

9. Keep investing over time
It can be easy to dump your money into the market and think you’re done. But those who build real wealth do so over time, by adding money to their investments. That means having a strong saving discipline – holding back some of your paycheck – so that you can put it to work in the stock market. You’ll be able to put more money to work and grow your wealth even faster.

You may already be doing this if you have a 401(k) retirement account, which takes money from your biweekly pay and puts it into the investments you’ve selected. Even if you don’t have a 401(k), many brokerage accounts allow you to set up automatic transfers to your account. Then you may be able to set up automatic investments at a broker or one of the best robo-advisors.

You can automate the process of investing, helping to keep your emotions out of the process.

How the stock market works
The stock market is really a way for investors or brokers to exchange stocks for money, or vice versa. Anyone who wants to buy stock can go there and buy whatever is on offer from those who own the stock. Buyers are expecting their stocks to rise, while sellers may be expecting their stocks to fall or at least not rise much more.

So the stock market allows investors to wager on the future of a company. In aggregate, investors set the value of the company by what price they’re willing to buy and sell at.

While stock prices in the market on any day may fluctuate according to how many shares are demanded or supplied, over time the market evaluates a company on its business results and future prospects. A business growing sales and profits will likely see its stock rise, while a shrinking business will probably see its stock fall, at least over time. In the short term, however, the performance of a stock has a lot to do with just the supply and demand in the market.

When private firms see which stocks investors favor, they may decide to fund their business by selling stock and raising cash. They’ll conduct an initial public offering, or IPO, using an investment bank, which sells shares to investors. Then investors can sell their stock later in the stock market if they want to or they can buy even more at any time the stock is publicly traded.

The key point is this: investors price stocks according to their expectations of how the company’s business will perform in the future. So the market is forward-looking, with some experts saying the market anticipates events about six to nine months away.

Risks and benefits of investing in stocks
The stock market allows individual investors to own stakes in some of the world’s best companies, and that can be tremendously lucrative. In aggregate, stocks are a good long-term investment as long as they’re purchased at reasonable prices. For example, over time the S&P 500 has generated about a 10 percent annual return, including a nice cash dividend, too.

Investing in stocks also offers another nice tax advantage for long-term investors. As long as you don’t sell your stock, you won’t owe any tax on the gains. Only money that you receive, such as dividends, will be taxable. So you can hold your stock forever and never have to pay taxes on your gains.

However, if you do realize a gain by selling the stock, you’ll owe capital gains taxes on it. How long you hold the stock will determine how it’s taxed. If you buy and sell the asset within a year, it will fall under short-term capital gains and will be taxed at your regular income tax rate. If you sell after you’ve held the asset a year, then you’ll pay the long-term capital gains rate, which is usually lower. If you record a loss, you can write that off your taxes or against your gains.

While the market as a whole has performed well, many stocks in the market don’t perform well and may even go bankrupt. These stocks are eventually worth zero, and they’re a total loss. On the other hand, some stocks such as Amazon and Apple have continued to soar for years, earning investors hundreds of times their initial investment.

So investors have two big ways to win in the stock market:

Buy a stock fund based on an index, such as the S&P 500, and hold it to capture the index’s long-term return. However, its return can vary markedly, from down 30 percent in one year to up 30 percent in another. By buying an index fund, you’ll get the weighted average performance of the stocks in the index.
Buy individual stocks and try to find the stocks that will outperform the average. However, this approach takes a tremendous amount of skill and knowledge, and it’s more risky than simply buying an index fund. However, if you can find an Apple or Amazon on the way up, your returns are likely going to be much higher than in an index fund.
Bottom line
Investing in the stock market can be very rewarding, especially if you avoid some of the pitfalls that most new investors experience when starting out. Beginners should find an investing plan that works for them and stick to it through the good times and bad."
134,Not Misleading,"**Title: Unconventional Investment Approaches for the Modern Maverick**

In today's dynamic financial landscape, the basics of investing have evolved beyond the traditional advice of diversification and long-term thinking. As people navigate the complexities of the modern world, they encounter unique challenges that require out-of-the-box solutions. Let's explore some unconventional investment approaches that address common problems faced by individuals in their daily lives.

**1. Invest in Your Network:**
Beyond stocks and bonds, your network can be a powerful asset. In a world driven by connections, investing time and effort into building a strong professional and personal network can yield remarkable returns. Attend industry events, engage in online forums, and foster meaningful relationships. Your network can offer opportunities, collaborations, and insights that traditional investments might not.

**2. Emotional Investment in Personal Development:**
Investing isn't just about money; it's about personal growth too. Allocate time and resources to develop new skills, expand your knowledge, and enhance your emotional intelligence. These investments in yourself can lead to improved decision-making, better career prospects, and a more fulfilling life.

**3. The ""Side Hustle"" Portfolio:**
The gig economy is booming, and many people are finding financial success by monetizing their hobbies and passions. Treat your side hustles as a unique investment portfolio. Diversify your income streams by turning your creative pursuits into money-making ventures. Not only does this provide extra income, but it also hedges against economic uncertainty.

**4. Environmental and Social Impact Investments:**
Consider aligning your investments with your values. Environmental and social impact investments not only generate financial returns but also contribute to a better world. Whether it's investing in clean energy, sustainable agriculture, or social enterprises, these ventures can solve real-world problems while potentially yielding competitive profits.

**5. Invest in Relationships:**
Strong relationships are invaluable. Instead of focusing solely on financial investments, prioritize investments in your relationships. Spend quality time with loved ones, nurture friendships, and build a strong support system. These emotional investments can lead to a happier and more fulfilling life.

**6. Health and Wellness Investments:**
Your health is your true wealth. Investing in your physical and mental well-being can lead to a more productive and enjoyable life. Whether it's a gym membership, healthy food choices, or mindfulness practices, these investments can prevent future healthcare expenses and enhance your overall quality of life.

**7. Learning from Micro-Investments:**
Apply the concept of micro-investing to your daily life. Just as you invest small amounts of money regularly, invest small pockets of time in learning. Dedicate a few minutes each day to reading educational content, listening to podcasts, or taking online courses. Over time, these micro-investments in learning can compound into valuable knowledge.

In conclusion, the basics of investing have expanded beyond traditional financial assets. By thinking creatively and strategically, you can address common problems faced in daily life through unconventional investment approaches. Whether you're investing in relationships, personal development, or social impact, the key is to adapt and innovate in a rapidly changing world."
135,Not Misleading,"**Title: Embracing the New Normal: Innovative Solutions for Everyday Challenges**

In our ever-evolving world, daily life presents a myriad of challenges that demand fresh perspectives and inventive solutions. Let's explore some out-of-the-box ideas to tackle these problems head-on and make life smoother, more efficient, and enjoyable for everyone.

**1. Commute-sharing Cooperatives:**
Traffic congestion and commuting stress are constant companions in many urban areas. Imagine forming local commute-sharing cooperatives where neighbors with similar destinations share rides, cutting down on traffic and emissions while building a stronger sense of community.

**2. Gamified Eco-Friendly Practices:**
Encouraging environmentally friendly behavior can be made engaging through gamification. Develop apps that reward users for recycling, reducing energy consumption, and adopting sustainable habits. This approach can transform eco-consciousness into a fun and collective effort.

**3. Virtual Health and Wellness Concierge:**
Maintaining health and well-being is a top priority, but the options can be overwhelming. An AI-powered virtual concierge could provide personalized wellness plans, suggest workouts, recipes, and even organize telehealth appointments, ensuring that health remains paramount amidst our busy lives.

**4. Rent-a-Garden Spaces:**
Not everyone has access to green spaces for gardening or relaxation. Create a platform where individuals can rent garden spaces for a few hours, allowing urban dwellers to reconnect with nature, grow their own produce, and enjoy a temporary sanctuary.

**5. Reverse Learning Platforms:**
In a world where information is abundant, why not learn from the younger generation? Create platforms where younger individuals teach older generations about technology, social media, and the latest trends, fostering intergenerational connections while bridging the digital divide.

**6. Community Repair Workshops:**
The throwaway culture contributes to environmental issues. Establish community repair workshops where people can learn to fix appliances, gadgets, and clothing. This not only reduces waste but also imparts valuable DIY skills.

**7. Shared Skill Exchange Meetups:**
Each person possesses unique skills. Organize meetups where individuals can exchange their expertise—like a coding whiz helping someone with cooking techniques. This not only imparts knowledge but also builds a strong sense of community reliance.

**8. Empathy Training in Schools:**
Empathy is a critical life skill. Integrate empathy training into school curricula to nurture emotionally intelligent individuals who are better equipped to understand and address the challenges of others in their personal and professional lives.

**9. Pop-up Entertainment and Learning Spaces:**
Transform underutilized spaces into pop-up hubs for entertainment and learning. Vacant lots can host open-air movie nights, while abandoned storefronts can become temporary art galleries or interactive learning centers, revitalizing neighborhoods.

**10. Digital Detox Retreats:**
In a hyper-connected world, digital detox is essential. Design retreats that offer guided relaxation, outdoor activities, and opportunities for deep reflection, enabling participants to disconnect from screens and reconnect with themselves.

In an era where innovation is the norm, applying creative solutions to daily challenges can lead to a more harmonious and fulfilling life. By embracing these new ideas, we can navigate the complexities of the modern world with enthusiasm and resilience."

Financial Navigating in the Current Economy: Ten Things to Consider Before You Make Investing Decisions
Invest Wisely: An Introduction to Mutual Funds. This publication explains the basics of mutual fund investing, how mutual funds work, what factors to consider before investing, and how to avoid common pitfalls.
/investor/pubs/inwsmf.htm


Financial Navigating in the Current Economy: Ten Things to Consider Before You Make Investing Decisions

Given recent market events, you may be wondering whether you should make changes to your investment portfolio.  The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy is concerned that some investors, including bargain hunters and mattress stuffers, are making rapid investment decisions without considering their long-term financial goals.  While we can’t tell you how to manage your investment portfolio during a volatile market, we are issuing this Investor Alert to give you the tools to make an informed decision.  Before you make any decision, consider these areas of importance:

1.         Draw a personal financial roadmap. 

Before you make any investing decision, sit down and take an honest look at your entire financial situation -- especially if you’ve never made a financial plan before. 

The first step to successful investing is figuring out your goals and risk tolerance – either on your own or with the help of a financial professional.  There is no guarantee that you’ll make money from your investments. But if you get the facts about saving and investing and follow through with an intelligent plan, you should be able to gain financial security over the years and enjoy the benefits of managing your money. 

2.         Evaluate your comfort zone in taking on risk.  

All investments involve some degree of risk. If you intend to purchase securities - such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds - it's important that you understand before you invest that you could lose some or all of your money.  Unlike deposits at FDIC-insured banks and NCUA-insured credit unions, the money you invest in securities typically is not federally insured.  You could lose your principal, which is the amount you've invested.  That’s true even if you purchase your investments through a bank.

The reward for taking on risk is the potential for a greater investment return. If you have a financial goal with a long time horizon, you are likely to make more money by carefully investing in asset categories with greater risk, like stocks or bonds, rather than restricting your investments to assets with less risk, like cash equivalents. On the other hand, investing solely in cash investments may be appropriate for short-term financial goals.  The principal concern for individuals investing in cash equivalents is inflation risk, which is the risk that inflation will outpace and erode returns over time.

Federally Insured Deposits at Banks and Credit Unions -- If you’re not sure if your deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, it’s easy to find out.  For bank accounts, go to www.myfdicinsurance.gov.  For credit union accounts, go to http://webapps.ncua.gov/Ins/.

3.         Consider an appropriate mix of investments.  

By including asset categories with investment returns that move up and down under different market conditions within a portfolio, an investor can help protect against significant losses.  Historically, the returns of the three major asset categories – stocks, bonds, and cash – have not moved up and down at the same time.  Market conditions that cause one asset category to do well often cause another asset category to have average or poor returns.  By investing in more than one asset category, you'll reduce the risk that you'll lose money and your portfolio's overall investment returns will have a smoother ride.  If one asset category's investment return falls, you'll be in a position to counteract your losses in that asset category with better investment returns in another asset category.

In addition, asset allocation is important because it has major impact on whether you will meet your financial goal.  If you don't include enough risk in your portfolio, your investments may not earn a large enough return to meet your goal.  For example, if you are saving for a long-term goal, such as retirement or college, most financial experts agree that you will likely need to include at least some stock or stock mutual funds in your portfolio.

Lifecycle Funds -- To accommodate investors who prefer to use one investment to save for a particular investment goal, such as retirement, some mutual fund companies have begun offering a product known as a ""lifecycle fund."" A lifecycle fund is a diversified mutual fund that automatically shifts towards a more conservative mix of investments as it approaches a particular year in the future, known as its ""target date."" A lifecycle fund investor picks a fund with the right target date based on his or her particular investment goal. The managers of the fund then make all decisions about asset allocation, diversification, and rebalancing. It's easy to identify a lifecycle fund because its name will likely refer to its target date. For example, you might see lifecycle funds with names like ""Portfolio 2015,"" ""Retirement Fund 2030,"" or ""Target 2045.”

4.         Be careful if investing heavily in shares of employer’s stock or any individual stock.

One of the most important ways to lessen the risks of investing is to diversify your investments. It’s common sense: don't put all your eggs in one basket.  By picking the right group of investments within an asset category, you may be able to limit your losses and reduce the fluctuations of investment returns without sacrificing too much potential gain. 

You’ll be exposed to significant investment risk if you invest heavily in shares of your employer’s stock or any individual stock.  If that stock does poorly or the company goes bankrupt, you’ll probably lose a lot of money (and perhaps your job). 

5.         Create and maintain an emergency fund. 

Most smart investors put enough money in a savings product to cover an emergency, like sudden unemployment.  Some make sure they have up to six months of their income in savings so that they know it will absolutely be there for them when they need it. 

6.         Pay off high interest credit card debt.

There is no investment strategy anywhere that pays off as well as, or with less risk than, merely paying off all high interest debt you may have. If you owe money on high interest credit cards, the wisest thing you can do under any market conditions is to pay off the balance in full as quickly as possible. 

7.         Consider dollar cost averaging.

Through the investment strategy known as “dollar cost averaging,” you can protect yourself from the risk of investing all of your money at the wrong time by following a consistent pattern of adding new money to your investment over a long period of time.  By making regular investments with the same amount of money each time, you will buy more of an investment when its price is low and less of the investment when its price is high.  Individuals that typically make a lump-sum contribution to an individual retirement account either at the end of the calendar year or in early April may want to consider “dollar cost averaging” as an investment strategy, especially in a volatile market. 

8.            Take advantage of “free money” from employer. 

In many employer-sponsored retirement plans, the employer will match some or all of your contributions.  If your employer offers a retirement plan and you do not contribute enough to get your employer’s maximum match, you are passing up “free money” for your retirement savings. 

Keep Your Money Working -- In most cases, a workplace plan is the most effective way to save for retirement.  Consider your options carefully before borrowing from your retirement plan.  In particular, avoid using a 401(k) debit card, except as a last resort.  Money you borrow now will reduce the savings vailable to grow over the years and ultimately what you have when you retire.  Also, if you don’t repay the loan, you may pay federal income taxes and penalties.

9.         Consider rebalancing portfolio occasionally. 

Rebalancing is bringing your portfolio back to your original asset allocation mix.  By rebalancing, you'll ensure that your portfolio does not overemphasize one or more asset categories, and you'll return your portfolio to a comfortable level of risk.

Stick with Your Plan: Buy Low, Sell High -- Shifting money away from an asset category when it is doing well in favor an asset category that is doing poorly may not be easy, but it can be a wise move.  By cutting back on the current ""winners"" and adding more of the current so-called ""losers,"" rebalancing forces you to buy low and sell high.

You can rebalance your portfolio based either on the calendar or on your investments.  Many financial experts recommend that investors rebalance their portfolios on a regular time interval, such as every six or twelve months.  The advantage of this method is that the calendar is a reminder of when you should consider rebalancing.  Others recommend rebalancing only when the relative weight of an asset class increases or decreases more than a certain percentage that you've identified in advance.  The advantage of this method is that your investments tell you when to rebalance.  In either case, rebalancing tends to work best when done on a relatively infrequent basis.

10.       Avoid circumstances that can lead to fraud.

Scam artists read the headlines, too.  Often, they’ll use a highly publicized news item to lure potential investors and make their “opportunity” sound more legitimate.  The SEC recommends that you ask questions and check out the answers with an unbiased source before you invest.  Always take your time and talk to trusted friends and family members before investing.

137,Not Misleading,"After a bout of high inflation and the Federal Reserve rapidly raising interest rates, investors may still be reeling. With many top economists fearing a recession could be right around the corner, some investors may think there’s no good place to invest. But extend your investing horizon and the rest of 2023 could set you up for good returns later on.

So what are the best investments for this year? The list below starts with some safer picks and then moves on to those that should deliver higher returns but may be more volatile, giving you a healthy mix of growth and safety during what looks like a difficult market environment.

Why invest?
Investing can provide you with another source of income, fund your retirement or even get you out of a financial jam. Above all, investing grows your wealth — helping you meet your financial goals and increasing your purchasing power over time. Or maybe you’ve recently sold your home or come into some money. It’s a wise decision to let that money work for you.

While investing can build wealth, you’ll also want to balance potential gains with the risk involved. And you’ll want to be in a financial position to do so, meaning you’ll need manageable debt levels, have an adequate emergency fund and be able to ride out the ups and downs of the market without needing to access your money.

There are many ways to invest — from safe choices such as CDs and money market accounts to medium-risk options such as corporate bonds, and even higher-risk picks such as stock index funds. That’s great news because it means you can find investments that offer a variety of returns and fit your risk profile. It also means that you can combine investments to create a well-rounded and diversified — that is, safer — portfolio.

Overview: Best investments in 2023
1. High-yield savings accounts
Overview: A high-yield online savings account pays you interest on your cash balance. And just like a savings account at your brick-and-mortar bank, high-yield online savings accounts are accessible vehicles for your cash.

Who are they good for? A savings account is a good vehicle for those who need to access cash in the near future. A high-yield savings account also works well for risk-averse investors who want to avoid the risk that they won’t get their money back.

Risks: Many of the banks that offer these accounts are FDIC-insured, so you won’t have to worry about losing your deposits as long as you stay within federal insurance limits.

While high-yield savings accounts are considered safe investments, like CDs, you do run the risk of losing purchasing power over time due to inflation, if rates are too low.

Rewards: With fewer overhead costs, you can typically earn much higher interest rates at online banks than you would at a traditional brick and mortar bank.

Plus, you’ll likely have easy access to the money by quickly transferring it to your primary bank or maybe even via an ATM.

Where to get them: You can browse Bankrate’s list of best high-yield savings accounts for a top rate. Otherwise, you can turn to your local bank or credit union, though you may not get the best rate.

2. Short-term certificates of deposit
Overview: Certificates of deposit, or CDs, are issued by banks and generally offer a higher interest rate than savings accounts. And short-term CDs may be better options when you expect rates to rise, allowing you to re-invest at higher rates when the CD matures.

Who are they good for? Because of their safety and higher payouts, CDs can be a good choice for retirees who don’t need immediate income and are able to lock up their money for a little bit.

A CD works well for risk-averse investors, especially those who need money at a specific time and can tie up their cash in exchange for a bit more yield than they’d find on a savings account.

Risks: CDs are considered safe investments. But they do carry reinvestment risk — the risk that when interest rates fall, investors will earn less when they reinvest principal and interest in new CDs with lower rates, as we saw in 2020 and 2021.

The opposite risk is that rates will rise and investors won’t be able to take advantage because they’ve already locked their money into a CD. And with rates expected to rise even further in 2023, it may make sense to stick to short-term CDs, so that you can reinvest at higher rates in the near future.

It’s important to note that inflation and taxes could significantly erode the purchasing power of your investment.

Rewards: With a CD, the financial institution pays you interest at regular intervals. Once it matures, you get your original principal back plus any accrued interest.

It pays to shop around online for the best CD rates.

Where to get them: Bankrate’s list of best CD rates will help you find the best rate across the nation, instead of having to rely on what’s available only in your local area.

Alternatively, many brick-and-mortar banks and credit unions offer CDs, though you’re not likely to find the best rate locally.

3. Series I bonds
Overview: The U.S. Treasury issues savings bonds for individual investors, and an increasingly popular option is the Series I bond. This bond helps build in protection against inflation. It pays a base interest rate and then adds on a component based on the inflation rate. The result: If inflation rises, so does the payout. But the reverse is true: If inflation falls, so will the interest rate. The inflation adjustment resets every six months.

Who are they good for? Like other government-issued debt, Series I bonds are attractive for risk-averse investors who do not want to run any risk of default. These bonds are also a good option for investors who want to protect their investment against inflation. However, investors are limited to buying $10,000 in any single calendar year, though you can apply up to an additional $5,000 in your annual tax refund to the purchase of Series I bonds, too. (And there’s a little-known secret to get around that annual limit, too.)

Risks: The Series I bond protects your investment against inflation, which is a key downside to investing in most bonds. And like other government-issued debt, these bonds are considered among the safest in the world against the risk of default.

Rewards: Series I bonds earn interest for 30 years if they are not redeemed for cash, but the rate will fluctuate with the prevailing rate of inflation.

Where to get them: You can buy Series I bonds directly from the U.S. Treasury at treasurydirect.gov. The government will not charge you a commission for doing so.

4. Short-term corporate bond funds
Overview: Corporations sometimes raise money by issuing bonds to investors, and these can be packaged into bond funds that own bonds issued by potentially hundreds of corporations.

Short-term bonds have an average maturity of one to five years, which makes them less susceptible to interest rate fluctuations than intermediate- or long-term bonds.

Who are they good for? Corporate bond funds can be an excellent choice for investors looking for cash flow, such as retirees, or those who want to reduce their overall portfolio risk but still earn a return. Short-term corporate bond funds can be good for risk-averse investors who want a bit more yield than government bond funds.

Risks: As is the case with other bond funds, short-term corporate bond funds are not FDIC-insured.

There is always the chance that companies will have their credit rating downgraded or run into financial trouble and default on the bonds. To reduce that risk, make sure your fund is made up of high-quality corporate bonds.

Rewards: Investment-grade short-term bond funds often reward investors with higher returns than government and municipal bond funds. But the greater rewards come with added risk.

Where to get them: You can buy and sell corporate bond funds with any broker that allows you to trade ETFs or mutual funds.

Most brokers allow you to trade ETFs for no commission, whereas many brokers may require a commission or a minimum purchase to buy a mutual fund.

5. Dividend stock funds
Overview: Dividends are portions of a company’s profit that are paid out to shareholders, usually on a quarterly basis. So, dividend stocks are those stocks that offer a cash payout — and not all stocks do — while a fund packages up only dividend stocks into one easy-to-buy unit.

Who are they good for? Buying individual stocks, whether they pay dividends or not, is better suited for intermediate and advanced investors. But you can buy a group of them in a stock fund and reduce your risk. Dividend stock funds are a good selection for almost any kind of stock investor but can be better for those who are looking for income. Those who need income and can stay invested for longer periods may find these attractive.

Risks: As with any stock investments, dividend stocks come with risk. They’re considered safer than growth stocks or other non-dividend stocks, but you should choose your portfolio carefully.

Make sure you invest in companies with a solid history of dividend increases rather than selecting those with the highest current yield. That could be a sign of upcoming trouble. However, even well-regarded companies can be hit by a crisis, so a good reputation is finally not a protection against the company slashing its dividend or eliminating it entirely.

However, you eliminate many of these risks by buying a dividend stock fund with a diversified collection of assets, reducing your reliance on any single company.

Rewards: Even your stock market investments can become a little safer with stocks that pay dividends.

With a dividend stock, not only can you gain on your investment through long-term market appreciation, but you’ll also earn cash in the short term.

Where to get them: Dividend stock funds are available as either ETFs or mutual funds at any broker that deals in them. ETFs may be more advantageous because they often have no minimum purchase amount and are typically commission-free.

In contrast, mutual funds may require a minimum purchase and your broker may charge a commission for them, depending on the broker.

6. Value stock funds
Overview: These funds invest in value stocks, those that are more bargain-priced than others in the market.

Who are they good for? When stocks run up in valuation as they do from time to time, many investors wonder where they can put their investment dollars. Value stock funds may be a good option. Value stock funds are good for investors who are comfortable with the volatility associated with investing in stocks. Investors in stock funds need to have a longer-term investing horizon, too, at least three to five years to ride out any bumps in the market.

Risks: Value stock funds will tend to be safer than other kinds of stock funds because of their bargain price, but they’re still composed of stocks, so they will fluctuate a lot more than safer investments such as short-term bonds.

Value stock funds are not insured by the government, either.

Rewards: Value stocks tend to do better as interest rates rise and growth stocks become less attractive on a relative basis.

Many value stock funds also pay a dividend, so that’s an additional attraction for many investors.

Where to get them: Value stock funds can come in two major types: ETFs or mutual funds. ETFs are usually available commission-free and without a minimum purchase requirement at most major online brokers.

However, mutual funds may require a minimum purchase and online brokers may charge a commission to trade them.

7. REIT index funds
Overview: A real estate investment trust, or REIT, is one of the most attractive ways to invest in real estate. REITs pay out dividends in exchange for not being taxed at the corporate level, and REIT index funds pass those dividends along to investors. Publicly traded REIT funds can include dozens of stocks and allow you to buy into many sub-sectors (lodging, apartments, office and many more) in a single fund. They’re a good way for investors to get diversified exposure to real estate without worrying about the headaches of managing the property yourself.

Who are they good for? REIT index funds pay out substantial dividends, making them an attractive place for income-focused investors, such as retirees. But REITs also tend to grow over time, so there’s some potential for capital appreciation, too. Prices of publicly traded REITs can fluctuate markedly, so investors need to take a long-term focus and be willing to deal with the volatility.

Risks: Owning a REIT index fund can take a lot of the risk out of owning individual REITs, because the fund offers diversification, allowing you to own many REITs inside a single fund. But the fund price will fluctuate, especially as interest rates rise. Watch out for REITs or REIT funds that aren’t publicly traded, however.

Rewards: Investors can win in two ways, with a growing stream of dividends and capital appreciation. Over time a good REIT fund could earn 10 to 12 percent annual returns, with a chunk of that as cash dividends.

Where to get them: You can purchase a REIT fund at any broker that allows you to trade ETFs or mutual funds. ETFs are typically commission-free, while mutual funds may charge a commission and require you to make a minimum purchase.

8. S&P 500 index funds
Overview: An S&P 500 index fund is based on about five hundred of the largest American companies, meaning it comprises many of the most successful companies in the world. For example, Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway are two of the most prominent member companies in the index.

Who are they good for? If you want to achieve higher returns than more traditional banking products or bonds, a good alternative is an S&P 500 index fund, though it does come with more volatility. An S&P 500 index fund is an excellent choice for beginning investors because it provides broad, diversified exposure to the stock market. An S&P 500 index fund is a good choice for any stock investor looking for a diversified investment and who can stay invested for at least three to five years.

Risks: An S&P 500 fund is one of the less-risky ways to invest in stocks, because it’s made up of the market’s top companies and is highly diversified. Of course, it still includes stocks, so it’s going to be more volatile than bonds or any bank products.

It’s also not insured by the government, so you can lose money based on fluctuations in value. However, the index has done quite well over time.

The index rallied furiously after its pandemic-driven plunge in March 2020, but performed poorly in 2022, so investors may want to proceed with caution and stick to their long-term investment plan.

Rewards: Like nearly any fund, an S&P 500 index fund offers immediate diversification, allowing you to own a piece of all of those companies. The fund includes companies from every industry, making it more resilient than many investments.

Over time, the index has returned about 10 percent annually. These funds can be purchased with very low expense ratios (how much the management company charges to run the fund) and they’re some of the best index funds.

Where to get them: You can purchase an S&P 500 index fund at any broker that allows you to trade ETFs or mutual funds. ETFs are typically commission-free, so you won’t pay any extra charge, whereas mutual funds may charge a commission and require you to make a minimum purchase.

9. Nasdaq-100 index funds
Overview: An index fund based on the Nasdaq-100 is a great choice for investors who want to have exposure to some of the biggest and best tech companies without having to pick the winners and losers or having to analyze specific companies.

The fund is based on the Nasdaq’s 100 largest companies, meaning they’re among the most successful and stable. Such companies include Apple and Alphabet, each of which comprises a large portion of the total index. Microsoft is another prominent member company.

Who are they good for? A Nasdaq-100 index fund is a good selection for stock investors looking for growth and willing to deal with significant volatility. Investors should be able to commit to holding it for at least three to five years. Using dollar-cost averaging to buy into an index fund can help reduce your risk, compared to buying in with a lump sum.

Risks: Like any publicly traded stock, this collection of stocks can move down, too. While the Nasdaq-100 has some of the strongest tech companies, these companies also are usually some of the most highly valued.

That high valuation means that they’re likely prone to falling quickly in a downturn, though they may rise quickly during an economic recovery.

Rewards: A Nasdaq-100 index fund offers you immediate diversification, so that your portfolio is not exposed to the failure of any single company.

The best Nasdaq index funds charge a very low expense ratio, and they’re a cheap way to own all the companies in the index.

Where to get them: Nasdaq-100 index funds are available as both ETFs and mutual funds. Most brokers allow you to trade ETFs without a commission, while mutual funds may charge a commission and have a minimum purchase amount.

10. Rental housing
Overview: Rental housing can be a great investment if you have the willingness to manage your own properties. To pursue this route, you’ll have to select the right property, finance it or buy it outright, maintain it and deal with tenants. You can do very well if you make smart purchases. With housing prices cooling off in 2023, a strategic purchase of real estate could work out well in the long term.

Who are they good for? Rental housing is a good investment for long-term investors who want to manage their own properties and generate regular cash flow.

Risks: You won’t enjoy the ease of buying and selling your assets in the stock market with a click or a tap on your internet-enabled device.

Worse, you might have to endure the occasional 3 a.m. call about a burst pipe.

Rewards: Despite mortgage rates climbing higher, it still may be a good time to finance the purchase of a new property, though the unstable economy may make it harder to actually run it.

If you hold your assets over time, gradually pay down debt and grow your rents, you’ll likely have a powerful cash flow when it comes time to retire.

Where to get them: You’ll likely need to work with a real estate broker to find rental housing, or you can work on building out a network that may be able to source you better deals before they hit the market.

What to consider
As you’re deciding what to invest in, you’ll want to consider several factors, including your risk tolerance, time horizon, your knowledge of investing, your financial situation and how much you can invest.

If you’re looking to grow wealth, you can opt for lower-risk investments that pay a modest return, or you can take on more risk and aim for a higher return. There’s typically a trade-off in investing between risk and return. Or you can take a balanced approach, having absolutely safe money investments while still giving yourself the opportunity for long-term growth.

The best investments for 2023 allow you to do both, with varying levels of risk and return.

Risk tolerance
Risk tolerance means how much you can withstand when it comes to fluctuations in the value of your investments. Are you willing to take big risks to potentially get big returns? Or do you need a more conservative portfolio? Risk tolerance can be psychological as well as simply what your personal financial situation requires.

Conservative investors or those nearing retirement may be more comfortable allocating a larger percentage of their portfolios to less-risky investments. These are also great for people saving for both short- and intermediate-term goals. If the market becomes volatile, investments in CDs and other FDIC-protected accounts won’t lose value and will be there when you need them.

Those with stronger stomachs, workers still accumulating a retirement nest egg and those with a decade or more until they need the money are likely to fare better with riskier portfolios, as long as they diversify. A longer time horizon allows you to ride out the volatility of stocks and take advantage of their potentially higher return, for example.

Time horizon
Time horizon simply means when you need the money. Do you need the money tomorrow or in 30 years? Are you saving for a house down payment in three years or are you looking to use your money in retirement? Time horizon determines what kinds of investments are more appropriate.

If you have a shorter time horizon, you need the money to be in the account at a specific point in time and not tied up. And that means you need safer investments such as savings accounts, CDs or maybe bonds. These fluctuate less and are generally safer.

If you have a longer time horizon, you can afford to take some risks with higher-return but more volatile investments. Your time horizon allows you to ride out the ups and downs of the market, hopefully on the way to greater long-term returns. With a longer time horizon, you can invest in stocks and stock funds and then be able to hold them for at least three to five years.

It’s important that your investments are calibrated to your time horizon. You don’t want to put next month’s rent money in the stock market and hope it’s there when you need it.

Your knowledge
Your knowledge of investing plays a key role in what you’re investing in. Investments such as savings accounts and CDs require little knowledge, especially since your account is protected by the FDIC. But market-based products such as stocks and bonds require more knowledge.

If you want to invest in assets that require more knowledge, you’ll have to develop your understanding of them. For example, if you want to invest in individual stocks, you need a great deal of knowledge about the company, the industry, the products, the competitive landscape, the company’s finances and much more. Many people don’t have the time to invest in this process.

However, there are ways to take advantage of the market even if you have less knowledge. One of the best is an index fund, which includes a collection of stocks. If any single stock performs poorly, it’s likely not going to affect the index much. In effect, you’re investing in the performance of dozens, if not hundreds, of stocks, which is more a wager on the market’s overall performance.

So you’ll want to understand the limits of your knowledge as you think about investments. (Here’s how to research stocks like the pros.)

How much you can invest
How much can you bring to an investment? The more money you can invest, the more likely it’s going to be worthwhile to investigate higher-risk, higher-return investments.

If you can bring more money, it can be worthwhile to make the time investment required to understand a specific stock or industry, because the potential rewards are so much greater than with bank products such as CDs.

Otherwise, it may not simply be worth your time. So, you may stick with bank products or turn to ETFs or mutual funds that require less time investment. These products can also work well for those who want to add to the account incrementally, as 401(k) participants do.

Bottom line
Investing can be a great way to build your wealth over time, and investors have a range of investment options, from safe lower-return assets to riskier, higher-return ones. That range means you’ll need to understand the pros and cons of each investment option and how they fit into your overall financial plan in order to make an informed decision. While it seems daunting at first, many investors manage their own assets.

But the first step to investing is actually easy: opening a brokerage account. Investing can be surprisingly affordable even if you don’t have a lot of money. (Here are some of the best brokers to choose from if you’re just getting started.)"
138,Not Misleading,"The 80/20 Rule
The Pareto Principle is a helpful concept to keep in mind when starting a task that encompasses a vast amount of information, such as the topic ""how to pick your investments."" In many aspects of life and learning, 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort. This principle, named after economist Vilfredo Pareto, is often called the “80/20 rule.”

We’ll follow this rule and focus on the core ideas and measurements that represent the majority of sound investment practices.

Know Your Timeline
You need to commit to a period of time during which you will leave those investments untouched. A reasonable rate of return can be expected only with a long-term horizon.

When investments have a long time to appreciate, they’re more likely to weather the inevitable ups and downs of the equities market.

It may be possible to generate a return in the short term, but it's not probable. As legendary investor Warren Buffett says, “you can't produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.”

The Magic of Compounding
Another important reason to leave your investments untouched for several years is to take advantage of compounding. 

When people cite “the snowball effect,” they’re talking about the power of compounding. When you start earning money on the money your investments have already earned, you’re experiencing compound growth.

This is why people who start the investing game earlier in life can vastly outperform late starters. They get the benefit of compounding growth over a longer period of time.

Choose the Right Asset Classes
Asset allocation means putting your investment capital into several types of investments, each representing a percentage of the whole. Allocating assets into different classes that are not highly correlated in their price action can be a highly effective way of diversifying risk.

For example, you might put half your money in stocks and the other half in bonds. If you want to diversify your portfolio further, you might expand beyond those two classes and include real estate investment trusts (REITs), commodities, forex, or international stocks.

To know the right allocation strategy for you, you need to understand your tolerance for risk. If temporary losses keep you awake at night, concentrate on lower-risk options like bonds. If you can weather setbacks in the pursuit of aggressive long-term growth, go for stocks.

Neither is an all-or-nothing decision. Even the most cautious investor should mix in a few blue-chip stocks or a stock index fund, knowing that those safe bonds will offset any losses. And even the most fearless investor should add some bonds to cushion a precipitous drop.

The Rewards of Diversification
Choosing among various asset classes doesn't just manage risk. Greater rewards come from diversification.

Nobel Prize-winning economist Harry Markowitz referred to this reward as “the only free lunch in finance.” You will earn more if you diversify your portfolio.

Here’s an example of what Markowitz meant: An investment of $100 in the S&P 500 in 1970 would have grown to $7,771 by the close of 2013. Investing the same amount over the same period in commodities (such as the benchmark S&P GSCI Index) would have made your money grow to $4,829.

Now, imagine you adopt both strategies. If you had invested $50 in the S&P 500 and the other $50 in the S&P GSCI, your total investment would have grown to $9,457 over the same period. This means your return would have surpassed the S&P 500-only portfolio by 20% and be almost double that of the S&P GSCI performance.

A blended approach works better.

Traditional and Alternative Assets
Most financial professionals divide all investments broadly into two categories, traditional assets and alternative assets.

Traditional assets include stocks, bonds, and cash. Cash is money in the bank, including savings accounts and certificates of deposit.
Alternative assets are everything else, including commodities, real estate, foreign currency, art, collectibles, derivatives, venture capital, special insurance products, and private equity.
Most individual investors will find that a combination of stocks and bonds, plus a cash cushion, is ideal. Everything else takes highly specialized knowledge. If you're an expert on antique Chinese porcelains, go for it. If you're not, you're better off sticking with the basics.

Balancing Stocks and Bonds
If most investors can reach their goals with a combination of stocks and bonds, then the ultimate question is, how much of each class should they pick? Let history be a guide.

If a higher return is your goal, and you can tolerate the higher risk, mostly stocks are the way to go. The fact is, the total return on stocks historically has been much higher than for all other asset classes. 

In his book Stocks for the Long Run, author Jeremy Siegel makes a powerful case for designing a portfolio consisting primarily of stocks.
1

His rationale: “Over the 210 years I have examined stock returns, the real return on a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks has averaged 6.6% per year,” Siegel says. 

A risk-averse investor may be uncomfortable with even short-term volatility and choose the relative safety of bonds, but the return will be lower. “At the end of 2012, the yield on nominal bonds was about 2%,"" Siegel notes. ""The only way that bonds could generate a 7.8% real return is if the consumer price index fell by nearly 6% per year over the next 30 years. Yet a deflation of this magnitude has never been sustained by any country in world history.”

Cash Is Not an Option
Whatever mix choose, make sure that you make a choice. Hoarding cash is not an option for investors because inflation erodes the real value of cash. Case in point: At a rate of 3% inflation per year, $100,000 will be worth just $40,000 in 30 years.

Your age is as relevant as your personality. As you get closer to retirement, you should take fewer risks that could jeopardize your account balance just when you need it.

Some people choose their stock/bond balance by using the “120 rule.” The idea is simple: Subtract your age from 120. The resulting number is the portion of the money you place in stocks. The rest goes into bonds. Therefore, a 40-year-old would invest 80% in stocks and 20% in bonds. Ten years later, the same person should have 70% in stocks and 30% in bonds.

How to Pick Stocks
Now that we can see that stocks offer higher long-term appreciation than bonds, let's look at the factors an investor needs to consider when evaluating stocks.

$40,000
The real spending power of $100,000 after 30 years of 3% inflation.

In keeping with the Pareto Principle, we’ll consider the five most important aspects. They are dividends, P/E ratio, historical return, beta and earnings per share (EPS).

Dividends
Dividends are a powerful way to boost your earnings. The frequency and amount of the dividend are subject to the company’s discretion and they are largely driven by the company's financial performance. More established companies typically pay dividends.

And dividends are a serious driver of wealth. Going back to 1960, 82% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index can be attributed to reinvested dividends and the power of compounding, according to a Hartford Funds white paper.
2

In addition, dividend payments are a sign of a healthy company.

P/E Ratio
A price-earnings ratio is the company's current share price compared to its earnings per share. A P/E ratio of 15, for example, tells us that investors are willing to pay $15 for every $1 of earnings the business earns over one year.

The P/E ratio is the most commonly used measure of a stock’s relative value.

A high P/E ratio indicates that investors have greater expectations for a company. Those expectations may be unrealistic because investors are handing over more money in anticipation of future earnings--even though they cannot expect to know the future outcomes for the company.

A low P/E ratio may indicate that a company is undervalued, or that investors expect the company to face more difficult times ahead.

What is the ideal P/E ratio? There’s no perfect number. However, investors can use the average P/E ratio of other companies in the same industry to form a baseline. For example, the average P/E ratio in the healthcare products industry is 161. The average in the auto and truck industry is just 15.

A stock’s P/E ratio is easy to find on most financial reporting websites.

Beta
This number indicates the volatility of a stock in comparison to the market as a whole. A security with a beta of 1 will exhibit volatility that’s identical to that of the market. Any stock with a beta of below 1 is theoretically less volatile than the market. A stock with a beta of above 1 is theoretically more volatile than the market.

For example, a security with a beta of 1.3 is 30% more volatile than the market. If the S&P 500 rises 5%, a stock with a beta of 1.3 can be expected to rise by 8%.

Beta is a good measurement to use if you want to own stocks but also want to mitigate the effect of market swings. 

Earnings Per Share (EPS)
EPS is a dollar figure representing the portion of a company’s earnings, after taxes and preferred stock dividends, that is allocated to each share of common stock.

Investors can use this number to gauge how well a company can deliver value to shareholders. A higher EPS begets higher share prices. The number is particularly useful in comparison to a company's earnings estimates. If a company regularly fails to deliver on earnings forecasts, an investor may want to reconsider purchasing the stock.

The calculation is simple. If a company has a net income of $40 million and pays $4 million in dividends, then the remaining sum of $36 million is divided by the number of shares outstanding. If there are 20 million shares outstanding, the EPS is $1.80 ($36M / 20M shares outstanding).

Historical Returns
Investors often get interested in a stock after reading headlines about its phenomenal performance. Just remember, that's yesterday's news.

Or, as the investing brochures always phrase it, ""Past performance is not a predictor of future returns.""

Sound investing decisions should consider context. A look at the trend in prices over the previous 52 weeks at the least is necessary to get a sense of where a stock's price may go next.

Technical and Fundamental Analysis
You can pick investments for your portfolio through a process of technical analysis or fundamental analysis. Let’s look at what these terms mean, how they differ and which one is best for the average investor.

Technical Analysis
Technical analysts comb through enormous volumes of data in an effort to forecast the direction of stock prices. The data consists primarily of past pricing information and trading volume.

 Fundamental analysis fits the needs of most investors and has the benefit of making good sense in the real world.
Technical analysts are not interested in monetary policy or broad economic developments. They believe prices follow a pattern, and if they can decipher the pattern they can capitalize on it with well-timed trades.

In recent decades, technology has enabled more investors to practice this style of investing because the tools and the data are more accessible than ever.

Fundamental Analysis
Fundamental analysts consider the intrinsic value of a stock. They look at the prospects of the industry, the quality of the company management, the company's revenues, and its profit margin.

Many of the concepts discussed throughout this piece are common in the fundamental analyst’s world.

Technical analysis is best suited to someone who has the time and comfort level with data to put limitless numbers to use. Otherwise, fundamental analysis will fit the needs of most investors, and it has the benefit of making good sense in the real world.

Manage Costs 
Aim to keep costs low. Brokerage fees and mutual fund expense ratios pull money from your portfolio.

Those expenses cost you today and in the future. For example, over a period of 20 years, annual fees of 0.50% on a $100,000 investment will reduce the portfolio's value by $10,000. Over the same period, a 1% fee will reduce the same portfolio by $30,000.

Fees create opportunity costs by forcing you to miss the benefits of compounding.

The trend is with you. Many mutual fund companies and online brokers are lowering their fees in order to compete for clients. Take advantage of the trend and shop around for the lowest cost.

One of the best ways for beginners to learn how to invest in stocks is to put money in an online investment account, which can then be used to invest in shares of stock or stock mutual funds.

With many brokerage accounts, you can start investing for the price of a single share of stock. Some brokers also offer paper trading, which lets you learn how to buy and sell with stock market simulators before you invest any real money.

How to invest in stocks in six steps
The easiest way to invest in stocks is by purchasing individual stocks or stock funds through an online investment account, also known as a brokerage account. You can also invest in stocks through a robo-advisor or a financial advisor.

If you're ready to invest in stocks yourself, this six-step process may help you get started. First, figure out how hands-on you want to be. Then open an account, choose your investment strategy, set a budget, focus on the long-term and manage your portfolio as needed over time. (Keep in mind, a good rule of thumb is to build a diversified portfolio and then stay invested, even when the market has ups and downs.)

1. Decide how you want to invest in the stock market
There are several ways to approach stock investing. Choose the option below that best represents how you want to invest, and how hands-on you'd like to be in picking and choosing the stocks you invest in.

A. ""I'd like to choose stocks and stock funds on my own."" Keep reading; this article breaks down things hands-on investors need to know, including how to choose the right account for your needs and how to compare stock investments.

» See our roundup of the best online brokers

B. ""I'd like an expert to manage the process for me."" You may be a good candidate for a robo-advisor, a service that offers low-cost investment management. Virtually all of the major brokerage firms and many independent advisors offer these services, which invest your money for you based on your specific goals.

» View our picks for the best robo-advisors

C. “I’d like to start investing in my employer’s 401(k).” This is one of the most common ways for beginners to start investing.

In many ways, it teaches new investors some of the most proven investing methods: making small contributions on a regular basis, focusing on the long-term and taking a hands-off approach. Most 401(k)s offer a limited selection of stock mutual funds, but not access to individual stocks.

2. Choose an investing account
Once you have a preference in mind, you're ready to shop for an investment account. For the hands-on types, this usually means a brokerage account. For those who would like a little help, opening an account through a robo-advisor is a sensible option. We break down both processes below.

An important point: Both brokers and robo-advisors allow you to open an account with very little money.

» Check out our roundup of the best online brokerages for stock trading

The DIY option: opening a brokerage account
An online brokerage account likely offers your quickest and least expensive path to buying stocks, funds and a variety of other investments. With a broker, you can open an individual retirement account, also known as an IRA, or you can open a taxable brokerage account if you’re already saving adequately for retirement in an employer 401(k) or other plan.

» View our top picks for IRA accounts

We have a guide to opening a brokerage account if you need a deep dive. You'll want to evaluate brokers based on factors such as costs, investment selection and investor research and tools.

The passive option: opening a robo-advisor account
A robo-advisor offers the benefits of stock investing, but doesn't require its owner to do the legwork required to pick individual investments. Robo-advisor services provide complete investment management: These companies will ask you about your investing goals during the onboarding process and then build you a portfolio designed to achieve those aims.

This may sound expensive, but the management fees here are generally a fraction of the cost of what a human investment manager would charge: Most robo-advisors charge about 0.25% of your account balance. And yes — you can also get an IRA at a robo-advisor if you wish.

If you choose to open an account at a robo-advisor, you probably needn't read further in this article — the rest is just for those DIY types.

3. Learn the difference between investing in stocks and funds
Going the DIY route? Don't worry. Stock investing doesn't have to be complicated. For most people, stock market investing means choosing among these two investment types:

Stock mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. Mutual funds let you purchase small pieces of many different stocks in a single transaction. Index funds and ETFs are a kind of mutual fund that track an index; for example, a S&P 500 fund replicates that index by buying the stock of the companies in it.

When you invest in a fund, you also own small pieces of each of those companies. You can put several funds together to build a diversified portfolio. Note that stock mutual funds are also sometimes called equity mutual funds.

Individual stocks. If you’re after a specific company, you can buy a single share or a few shares as a way to dip your toe into the stock-trading waters. Building a diversified portfolio out of many individual stocks is possible, but it takes a significant investment and research.

If you go this route, remember that individual stocks will have ups and downs. If you research a company and choose to invest in it, think about why you picked that company in the first place if jitters start to set in on a down day.

The upside of stock mutual funds is that they are inherently diversified, which lessens your risk. For the vast majority of investors — particularly those who are investing their retirement savings — a portfolio made up of mostly mutual funds is the clear choice.

But mutual funds are unlikely to rise in meteoric fashion as some individual stocks might. The upside of individual stocks is that a wise pick can pay off handsomely, but the odds that any individual stock will make you rich are exceedingly slim.

4. Set a budget for your stock market investment
New investors often have two questions in this step of the process:

How much money do I need to start investing in stocks? The amount of money you need to buy an individual stock depends on how expensive the shares are. (Share prices can range from just a few dollars to a few thousand dollars.)

If you want mutual funds and have a small budget, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) may be your best bet. Mutual funds often have minimums of $1,000 or more, but ETFs trade like a stock, which means you purchase them for a share price — in some cases, less than $100).

How much money should I invest in stocks? If you’re investing through funds — have we mentioned this is the preference of most financial advisors? — you can allocate a fairly large portion of your portfolio toward stock funds, especially if you have a long time horizon.

A 30-year-old investing for retirement might have 80% of their portfolio in stock funds; the rest would be in bond funds. Individual stocks are another story. A general rule of thumb is to keep these to a small portion of your investment portfolio.

5. Focus on investing for the long-term
Stock market investments have proven to be one of the best ways to grow long-term wealth. Over several decades, the average stock market return is about 10% per year. However, remember that’s just an average across the entire market — some years will be up, some down and individual stocks will vary in their returns.

For long-term investors, the stock market is a good investment no matter what’s happening day-to-day or year-to-year; it’s that long-term average they’re looking for.

The best thing to do after you start investing in stocks or mutual funds may be the hardest: Don’t look at them. Unless you’re trying to beat the odds and succeed at day trading, it’s good to avoid the habit of compulsively checking how your stocks are doing several times a day, every day.

6. Manage your stock portfolio
While fretting over daily fluctuations won’t do much for your portfolio’s health — or your own — there will of course be times when you’ll need to check in on your stocks or other investments.

If you follow the steps above to buy mutual funds and individual stocks over time, you’ll want to revisit your portfolio a few times a year to make sure it’s still in line with your investment goals.

A few things to consider: If you’re approaching retirement, you may want to move some of your stock investments over to more conservative fixed-income investments. If your portfolio is too heavily weighted in one sector or industry, consider buying stocks or funds in a different sector to build more diversification.

Finally, pay attention to geographic diversification, too. Vanguard recommends international stocks make up as much as 40% of the stocks in your portfolio. You can purchase international stock mutual funds to get this exposure.

Best stocks for beginners
The process of picking stocks can be overwhelming, especially for beginners. After all, there are thousands of stocks listed on the major U.S. exchanges.

Stock investing is filled with intricate strategies and approaches, yet some of the most successful investors have done little more than stick with stock market basics.

That generally means using funds for the bulk of your portfolio — Warren Buffett has famously said a low-cost S&P 500 ETF is the best investment most Americans can make — and choosing individual stocks only if you believe in the company’s potential for long-term growth.

The S&P 500 is an index consisting of about 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. Over the last 50 years, its average annual return has been more or less the same as that of the market as a whole — about 10%.

The bottom line on investing in stocks
Learning how to invest in stocks can be daunting for beginners, but it’s really just a matter of figuring out which investment approach you want to use, what kind of account makes sense for you, and how much money you should put into stocks.

Frequently asked questions
Is stock investing safe for beginners?
Yes, if you approach it responsibly. As it turns out, investing isn’t as hard — or complex — as it might seem.

That’s because there are plenty of tools available to help you. One of the best is stock mutual funds, which are an easy and low-cost way for beginners to invest in the stock market. These funds are available within your 401(k), IRA or any taxable brokerage account.

An S&P 500 fund, which effectively buys you small pieces of ownership in about 500 of the largest U.S. companies, is a good place to start.

The other option, as referenced above, is a robo-advisor, which will build and manage a portfolio for you for a small fee.

Are stock investing apps safe?
Generally, yes, investing apps are safe to use. Some newer apps have had reliability issues in recent years, in which the app goes down and users are left without access to their funds or the app’s functionality is restricted for a limited period.

Even in these instances, your funds are typically still safe, but losing temporary access to your money is still a legitimate concern.

So, if you’re hoping to avoid these issues, you can choose an investing app from a large and established brokerage: Fidelity, TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab all receive top marks on our list of the best stock apps, and they’re also among the largest brokerages in the country.

Can I invest small amounts of money in stocks?
Yes. Most brokerages these days have $0 account minimums (meaning you can open an account without funding it first), and some brokers even have fractional trading, meaning you can invest low dollar amounts — think $5 or $10 — rather than pay for the price of an entire share.

However, investing small amounts comes with a challenge: diversifying your portfolio. Diversification, by nature, involves spreading your money around. The less money you have, the harder it is to spread.

One solution is to invest in stock index funds and ETFs. These often have low investment minimums (and ETFs are purchased for a share price that could be lower still), and some brokers, like Fidelity and Charles Schwab, offer index funds with no minimum at all.

And, index funds and ETFs cure the diversification issue because they hold many different stocks within a single fund.

The last thing we'll say on this: Investing is a long-term game, so you shouldn't invest money you might need in the short term. That includes a cash cushion for emergencies.

Is it really worth it to invest small amounts?
Regular investments over time, even small ones, can really add up. If you invested $100 per month for 30 years, and it grew conservatively at 6% annually, you could have over $100,000 after 30 years. (Use our investment calculator to see how compounding returns work in investing.)

The key to this strategy is making a long-term investment plan and sticking to it, rather than trying to buy and sell for short-term profit.

Are stocks a good investment for beginners?
Yes, as long as you’re comfortable leaving your money invested for at least five years. Why five years? That's because it is relatively rare for the stock market to experience a downturn that lasts longer than that.

But rather than trading individual stocks, focus on diversified products, such as index funds and ETFs.

It’s possible to build a diversified portfolio out of individual stocks, but doing so would be time-consuming — it takes a lot of research and know-how to manage a portfolio. Index funds and ETFs do that work for you.

What are the best stock market investments?
In our view, the best stock market investments are often low-cost mutual funds, like index funds and ETFs. By purchasing these instead of individual stocks, you can buy a big chunk of the stock market in one transaction.

Index funds and ETFs track a benchmark — for example, the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average — which means your fund’s performance will mirror that benchmark’s performance. If you’re invested in an S&P 500 index fund and the S&P 500 is up, your investment will be, too.

That means you won’t beat the market — but it also means the market won’t beat you. Investors who trade individual stocks instead of funds often underperform the market over the long term.

How do I choose my stock investments?
The answer to what you choose to invest in really comes down to two things: the time horizon for your goals, and how much risk you’re willing to take.

Let’s tackle time horizon first: If you’re investing for a far-off goal, like retirement, you should be invested primarily in stocks (again, we recommend you do that through mutual funds).

Investing in stocks will allow your money to grow and outpace inflation over time. As your goal gets closer, you can slowly start to dial back your stock allocation and add in more bonds, which are generally safer investments.

On the other hand, if you’re investing for a short-term goal — less than five years — you likely don’t want to be invested in stocks at all. Consider these short-term investments instead.

Finally, the other factor: risk tolerance. The stock market goes up and down, and if you’re prone to panicking when it does the latter, you’re better off investing slightly more conservatively, with a lighter allocation to stocks.

Not sure? We have a risk tolerance quiz — and more information about how to make this decision — in our article about what to invest in.

What stocks should I invest in?
One common approach is to invest in many stocks through a stock mutual fund, index fund or ETF — for example, an S&P 500 index fund that holds all the stocks in the S&P 500.

If you’re after the thrill of picking stocks, though, that likely won’t deliver. You can scratch that itch and keep your shirt by dedicating 10% or less of your portfolio to individual stocks. Which ones? Our full list of the best stocks, based on current performance, has some ideas.

Is stock trading for beginners?
While stocks are great for many beginner investors, the ""trading"" part of this proposition is probably not. A buy-and-hold strategy using stock mutual funds, index funds and ETFs is generally a better choice for beginners.

That’s precisely the opposite of stock trading, which involves dedication and a great deal of stock research. Stock traders attempt to time the market in search of opportunities to buy low and sell high.

Just to be clear: The goal of any investor is to buy low and sell high. But history tells us you’re likely to do that if you hold on to a diversified investment — like a mutual fund — over the long term. No active trading required.

Can I open a brokerage account if I live outside the U.S.?
This will depend on which broker you choose. Of the brokers NerdWallet reviews, Firstrade, TD Ameritrade, Interactive Brokers, TradeStation, ZacksTrade, Charles Schwab, and Webull are all open to international investors, with varying restrictions and requirements.

About the authors

Chris Davis
Chris Davis"
140,Not Misleading,"You now know how and where to save for retirement, and the difference between investing and saving. We’ve gone over some of our favorite types of investments, and repeatedly praised the stock market.

In fact, after reading Chapter 3, you might think we get a kickback every time someone invests in the stock market. We don’t. We firmly believe that a good portfolio is balanced between stocks and bonds.

Stocks are beneficial for their powerful growth and bonds for their steady income and low volatility. (What about cryptocurrencies and other alternative assets, you ask? Fine. But do your due diligence and consider how much risk you want to take on.  

In this chapter, we’ll help you consider what to invest in — how to divide your money between stocks and bonds — and give you ideas for choosing specific investments. If that doesn’t interest you, stick around anyway — we also have some info for how to hire a pro to help you, on the cheap.

Decide how much money to invest where
One rule of thumb for deciding where to invest your money and how to split your portfolio between stocks and bonds is to subtract your age from 100, and put the result — as a percentage of your pot of money — into stocks. So if you’re 30, that would mean investing 70% in stocks and the rest in bonds.

Unfortunately, rules of thumb aren’t perfect. Some financial advisors say that 30-something investors should put closer to 80% of their retirement savings in stocks. In other words, subtract your age from 110 and invest that amount in stocks.

Another way to get a little deeper into the best asset allocation for you is to answer these two questions:


1. How long until you need the money?
We discussed this question in Chapter 1. This is the same concept, but specifically about your planned retirement age, and how many years you have until you reach it.

If your answer is “Not until I retire 20 years from now,” then consider the stock market. That time frame gives you time to stomach the market’s ups and downs — and to enjoy the stock market’s bounty over time.

As you get close to retirement, you may want to consider shifting a portion of your portfolio to cash, such as a savings account, money market account or certificate of deposit. You’ll be within that five-year zone we talked about in Chapter 1, and you’ll want to make sure money you need to draw on for living expenses in the first few years of retirement will be available for you even if the market goes through a downturn.


2. How risk-averse are you?
When the stock market crashes, what’s your reaction going to be? If you can sit tight and focus on the long game, even as you’re watching your investments get temporarily decimated, you’re a good candidate for investing 80% or 90% in stocks.

But if your reaction to a market downturn will be to take your money and run, think about a less volatile investment portfolio. You’ll give up some potential gains, but if you’re likelier to stick with that portfolio through ups and downs, it’s worth it.

If you’re not sure how you’d react to a market downturn, we have a risk tolerance quiz at the bottom of the page to help you find out.

Choose your own investments...
So now you know you want to invest, say, 80% of your money in stocks and 20% in bonds. If you want to build your own retirement investment portfolio, your next decision is which stocks and bonds, specifically, to invest in. (If you’d really rather not get into these details, there’s no shame in getting help with this stuff. Below, we talk about inexpensive ways to get expert guidance.)

Investing for retirement isn’t all that complicated. You could build a fantastically diversified retirement portfolio by investing in just three mutual funds:

A mutual fund that invests in the entire U.S. stock market.

A mutual fund that invests in the entire international stock market.

A mutual fund that invests in the total U.S. bond market.

These mutual funds will allow you to invest in thousands of companies, plus hold a large variety of bonds — and they can power your retirement savings for decades.

» Looking for more investing ideas? See more sample retirement investment portfolios

Keep in mind that mutual funds have different names, depending on the provider. What you’ll see in your 401(k) or at your brokerage may vary. 

If you’re investing through a brokerage, you’ll have no trouble finding a total U.S. stock market fund, an international fund and a total U.S. bond market fund. Your 401(k), however, may have fewer options. If you don’t see funds resembling those three types, then consider a target-date fund. We discuss target-date funds in more detail below.

Each fund will have its own web page — on your 401(k) website or on the fund provider’s own website — where you can see what its strategy is (for example, investing in the total U.S. stock market).

That page is also where you can look at the fund’s fees — and you definitely want to look at the fees. Focus on the expense ratio: That’s the cost of the fund as a percentage of how much you’ve invested in that fund.

Note that the expense ratio for the same exact mutual fund may vary, depending on whether you’re investing through a 401(k) or not, and how much money you’re investing, so you need to check on that particular fund’s expense ratio by using the link found in your 401(k) or brokerage account.

Ideally, you’re investing in index mutual funds. As we mentioned in Chapter 3, they track an index comprising many companies, as opposed to actively managed funds, where a live human is picking the fund’s underlying investments. Index funds usually cost less. Look for mutual funds that have an expense ratio lower than 0.5%, if possible.

There’s an alternative to choosing your own investments: Hire a professional investor to do it for you, on the cheap.

If you’re investing through your 401(k) or another type of workplace plan, a target-date fund can be a great option for hands-off investing. Target-date funds are created by investment pros, and they’re set up to invest in a diversified group of mutual funds on your behalf, with a mix of U.S. international stocks and bonds, similar to what we described above.

These funds are named with a retirement year in mind — like XYZ Target Date Fund 2050 — and you choose the fund with the year that aligns with when you plan to retire. As you get closer to your retirement date, the mix of funds automatically adjusts to be less aggressive/volatile than it was when retirement was in the far distance (though plenty of target-date funds assume you’ll keep investing throughout retirement, and thus keep you invested at least partly in stocks long past your retirement year).

If you’re investing outside of a workplace plan, then you can get investment management through a digital advisor (also called a robo-advisor), such as Betterment or Wealthfront, or through an app such as Acorns or Stash.

Many robo-advisors have no account minimum, so you can get started with $10 or even less. Some robo-advisors have a 0% management fee. Some others charge a fee of 0.25% of your account balance.

You’ll fill out a questionnaire to give the robo-advisor a sense of how risk-tolerant you are and how long you plan to invest. That, in turn, helps it choose the best investments for you.

142,Not Misleading,"What Is Portfolio Management?
Too many young people either delay or forget entirely to invest for retirement. Some distant date that is 30 or 40 years in the future can be difficult to imagine, let alone care about today. And, without guaranteed pensions from employers and just a relatively small amount from Social Security, investments are often the best solution to supplement retirement income (if any), otherwise future retirees will often have a hard time paying for life's necessities.

One reason young people don't invest is they fail to understand stocks or basic concepts such as the diversification and the power of compounding. But it's not hard to learn. There are many sources of investing information, such as this website. Moreover, the earlier you start, the more time you have to build your wealth and ride out bear markets and periods of high volatility. Because of this, young people should get a leg up on portfolio management.

Portfolio management refers to the process of selecting and managing a set of investments that align with an individual's financial goals. The goal of portfolio management is to maximize expected returns while minimizing risk by holding a diverse range of assets. This process entails various strategies such as diversification, asset allocation, and risk management.

 The sooner you begin, the more time your investments will have to grow. Here we'll discuss some good ways to go about building a portfolio and how to manage it for the best results.

What Is a Portfolio in Investing?
A portfolio is a collection of investments, which can consist of a variety of asset classes such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The purpose of a portfolio is to achieve a balance between risk and return by selecting assets that are not highly correlated with one another, and which also align with an individual's financial goals.

The word ""portfolio"" comes from the Latin folium, meaning to ""carry leaves"" (as in papers). Stock and bond certificates were once only issued in paper form, from which this terminology was adopted. A portfolio is also used to describe an artist's collection of works, for similar reasoning.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Portfolio management involves investing in a variety of assets, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, to reduce risk and maximize returns.
To start managing a portfolio, it's important to establish financial goals and risk tolerance and create a diversified mix of assets.
Regular monitoring and rebalancing of the portfolio can help maintain alignment with investment goals and risk tolerance.
Keeping costs to a minimum and considering the long term are important principles of successful portfolio management.
Seeking the help of a financial advisor or using a roboadvisor can provide professional guidance and expertise to build and manage a successful portfolio.
How to Build a Portfolio
When building a portfolio, it may be tempting to select stocks from companies that you are already familiar with, or which appear to be hot stocks in the media or online. However, this is not usually the best way to build a smart portfolio. Instead, seek out a wide range of stocks from different industries, and also diversify across different asset classes beyond stocks, such as bonds, real estate, commodities, and even a small allocation to cryptocurrency. Holding a variety of securities across different asset classes can help balance out the risks and returns of the portfolio, and help mitigate the impact of market downturns on any one particular investment or group of investments..

Building a portfolio involves several steps.

First, it's important to determine your investment goals. These can be segmented by time horizon, with long-term goals like retirement layered onto more medium-term goals like a down payment for a house or a child's college education.
Second, evaluate your risk tolerance -- from conservative to aggressive, or in between. This includes both your capacity to take on risk (which is related to things like your age, time horizon, income, and financial situation), and your willingness to take on risk.
Next, you'll need to select a mix of assets that align with your goals and risk tolerance. It is important to have a good degree of diversification, which involves selecting assets from different asset classes, industries, and regions to spread risk without sacrificing expected return. In general, a more aggressive risk tolerance will feature a greater allocation to stocks, while a more conservative portfolio will hold relatively more bonds and cash (see the example Figures below)
Once you have selected your assets, it's important to monitor and adjust your portfolio periodically. This involves rebalancing your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.
If your goals or circumstances change or evolve, you may have to return to step one and begin the process again.

Conservative Portfolio
 Some investors want to take an active role in managing their investments, while others prefer to simply set it and forget it. Your preference for portfolio management style may change, but decide on one approach to get started. For set-it-and-forget it types, ""roboadvisors"" are becoming an increasingly popular and cost-effective solution.
Why Diversification Is Key
You've heard the old adage ""don't put all your eggs in one basket,"" and we've already mentioned that smart portfolio management involves diversification across asset classes and through holding a variety of securities within each one. This reduces the impact that any one asset or security will have on the overall portfolio.

The goal is to hold a range of securities that are not highly correlated with one another. When two assets are highly correlated, their prices tend to move in the same direction at the same time. For example, if you own two stocks in the same industry, their prices may rise and fall together based on the same industry-specific factors. On the other hand, holding assets that are not highly correlated means that their prices are less likely to move together, and may even move in opposite directions. This means that when one asset or security performs poorly, it is more likely to be balanced out by the positive performance of another asset or security. Thus, it is smart to hold to different asset classes as well as securities from a range of industries and geographic regions. Another way to diversify your portfolio is by investing in a mix of small, medium, and large companies. Often, larger companies have already achieved success, while smaller companies may be seen as more risky. However, smaller companies can also have greater potential for growth, which can help balance out the overall risk of the portfolio.

During an economic downturn, for instance, stocks may falter while bonds and gold might perform better. By holding a mix of assets across different asset classes, the losses in the stock portion of the portfolio may be balanced out by the gains in the bond and gold portions, reducing the overall impact of the market downturn on the portfolio.

An easy way to achieve good diversification, for beginners and seasoned investors alike, is to look to index mutual funds and ETFs that replicate broad asset class benchmarks like the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, or the Aggregate Bond Index. Index funds provide this diversification at very low cost are readily available through a variety of fund providers - so building a portfolio around various index products can be a smart and cost-effective strategy.

 It's important to remember that diversification does not eliminate risk altogether and losses can still occur; however, it can help reduce risk over the long term without sacrificing returns.
Why Is Portfolio Management Important?
Portfolio management is essential for achieving financial goals while minimizing risk. Without the proper planning and management, however, your portfolio can become unbalanced, subject to concentrated risks, and fail to meet your long-term goals. Winging it, following the crowd, going with your gut, or other types of uninformed portfolio construction can indeed be detrimental to your financial health.

A well-managed and diversified portfolio, on the other hand, can provide investors with higher returns and help them weather market downturns.

Because of its importance, it is often best to get an early start. Even if you don't feel comfortable opening a brokerage account right away, participate in your company's 401(k) retirement plan. If a 401(k) plan is not available through your employer, establish instead an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and earmark a percentage of your monthly compensation for a contribution to the account. An easy, convenient way to save in an IRA or 401(k) is to create an automatic monthly cash contribution.

Another reason to start managing your portfolio right early on is that the younger you are, the less likely you are to have certain financial obligations yet, such as those related to a spouse, children, and a mortgage, to name a few. Without these expenses, you can allocate a portion of your investment portfolio to higher-risk investments, which can yield higher returns over the long run. You'll probably also have more cash available for investments and a longer time horizon before retirement during your younger years. With more money to invest for more years ahead of you, you'll be on your way to having financial security and a more comfortable retirement nest egg.

Best Practices for Portfolio Management
There are several best practices for portfolio management. Here are a few key strategies to keep in mind:

Start with a plan: Before investing, it's important to establish your financial goals and risk tolerance. Take the time to think this through carefully, but also reflect and reconsider your goals from time to time as your personal circumstances change and evolve.
Research your investments: If you are actively managing your portfolio by choosing what stocks and other securities will go into it, be sure to understand the assets and securities in your portfolio, including their risks and potential returns. Research potential investments before making a purchase and continue to stay informed about how your investments are performing over time. If you don't have the time or knowledge to do your own due diligence, look instead to index funds and ETFs or automated platforms like roboadvisors.
Stay diversified: By investing in a mix of assets and securities, investors can reduce their exposure to any single asset or industry without sacrificing expected returns. Index funds and ETFs are an easy way to stay diversified, but pay attention to overlapping holdings that can undermine your efforts - for instance, if both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 have Apple (AAPL) stock as a top holding, you're effectively doubling up on that stock and amplifying that risk.
Monitor regularly and rebalance: It's important to periodically monitor and adjust your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Your asset allocation will change naturally due to market fluctuations, such that if stocks rise and bonds fall, your portfolio's weighting to stocks will increase relative to bonds. Rebalance your portfolio by adjusting your stake in each category to restore your original weightings.
Keep costs to a minimum: Management fees, trading commissions, and other costs can be a drag on your portfolio's performance. Luckily, today there are many online brokers offering zero-commission trading in most stocks and ETFs, and the expenses on ETFs and mutual funds have also come down considerably. Still, keep costs in mind and use strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize your tax bill.
Consider the long term: Investing is a long-term game. It's important to maintain a disciplined approach and not be swayed by short-term market fluctuations that can trigger emotions like fear and greed. Make sure that you stay the course and put money into your investments on a regular, disciplined basis. This may not be possible if, for example, you lose your job of course, but once you find new employment continue to put money into your portfolio.
Keep in mind that no investment strategy is foolproof, and even the most carefully constructed portfolio can be impacted by unexpected events, recessions, or market disruptions. However, by following these best practices and maintaining a disciplined, long-term approach to investing, you can help maximize your chances of achieving your financial goals.
 If you're new to investing or feel uncertain about your investment decisions, consider consulting with a financial advisor or opening an account at a roboadvisor. Both options can provide valuable advice and help you develop a personalized investment plan that aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
What are the types of portfolio management?
There are various types of portfolio management that investors can use to optimize their portfolios based on their financial goals and risk tolerance. Active portfolio management involves regular buying and selling of securities to generate ongoing returns, while passive management involves holding on to a diversified mix of assets to track the performance of a benchmark index.

Another categorization of portfolio management is strategic asset allocation, which involves a long-term, buy-and-hold approach to investing with a focus on asset class diversification and risk management. This can be contrasted with tactical asset allocation, which is a more flexible, short-term, and reactionary approach that involves adjusting asset allocations in response to market trends or changes in macroeconomic conditions.

What is the main objective of portfolio management?
The primary goal of portfolio management is to allow investors to maximize their returns while minimizing their risks. This involves selecting a diversified mix of investments that align with the investor's financial goals and risk tolerance, and adjusting the portfolio over time to ensure it remains aligned with those goals. Effective portfolio management also involves monitoring the portfolio's performance and rebalancing it periodically to ensure it stays diversified and doesn't become too heavily concentrated in any one asset class or security.

What are the key elements of portfolio management?
The key elements of portfolio management include establishing financial goals and risk tolerance, selecting a mix of assets and securities that align with those goals, monitoring and adjusting the portfolio over time, and managing costs. It's also important to stay disciplined and focused on the long-term, avoiding emotional decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Finally, investors should also minimize costs and consider the tax implications of their investments and use strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize their tax bill.

What should a well-diversified portfolio contain?
A well-diversified portfolio should contain a mix of assets and securities, including stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, and other alternative investments. The exact mix will depend on the investor's financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon, but a balanced approach that includes both equities and fixed-income securities is generally recommended. Within each asset class, it's important to maintain additional diversification by holding a range of companies and industries, rather than concentrating on a few specific stocks or sectors.

The Bottom Line
Portfolio management is the process of selecting and managing investments that align with an individual's financial goals. The goal of portfolio management is to maximize expected returns while minimizing risk. To build a smart portfolio, one should seek to include a wide range of stocks from different industries, regions, and company sizes, and to diversify across different asset classes. It's important to first determine your long-term investment goals and evaluate your risk tolerance, and it is also important to monitor and adjust your portfolio periodically. Less hands-on investors can still achieve cost-effective portfolio management through financial advisors or algorithmic platforms such as roboadvisors."

145,Not Misleading,"Are you a saver or spender?

If you went with the former, then you’re in the majority. According to a 2019 Charles Schwab survey, around 59% of Americans said they considered themselves savers. Compare that to more recent findings, however, and you’ll see that 63% of respondents in a similar demographic are currently living paycheck to paycheck.

Clearly, there’s a disconnect between the financial goals we are setting and the steps we are taking to realize them.

Many of us are taught from a young age that saving is the most direct path to building wealth and achieving financial freedom. But this is a myth. While saving is key in the pursuit of both goals, making smart investments with your money makes them much more attainable.

The fear that stops most people from investing is a reasonable one: financial loss as opposed to financial gain. When we work hard and are disciplined enough to forgo consumption and save, the idea of losing our hard-earned dollars understandably makes us uncomfortable. As a result, we tuck our money away in an FDIC-insured bank account.

Here’s the problem: The money we put into our accounts is almost guaranteed to lose value. The low interest rates that savings accounts offer can’t even keep pace with inflation, meaning our money’s purchasing power decreases the longer we save.

There is some good news, though. If you make smart decisions and invest in the right places, you can reduce the risk factor, increase the reward factor, and generate meaningful returns without feeling like you’d be better off in Vegas.

Here are a few questions to consider as you get started.

Why should you invest?
Saving versus investing is an oft-heard debate in financial circles. But they’re two sides of the same coin.

When building wealth, saving is an indispensable part of the financial toolbox — not because it produces wealth on its own, but because it provides the capital necessary to invest. At a minimum, investing allows you to keep pace with cost-of-living increases created by inflation. At a maximum, the major benefit of a long-term investment strategy is the possibility of compounding interest, or growth earned on growth.

How much should you save vs. invest?
Given that each investor enters the market because of unique circumstances, the best answer to how much you should save is “as much as possible.” As a guideline, saving 20% of your income is the right starting place. More is always better, but I believe that 20% allows you to accumulate a meaningful amount of capital throughout your career.

Initially, you’ll want to allocate these savings to building an emergency fund equal to roughly three to six months’ worth of ordinary expenses. Once you’ve socked away these emergency savings, invest additional funds that aren’t being put toward specific near-term expenses.

Invested wisely — and over a long period — this capital can multiply.

How do investments work? 
Understanding the market: In the finance world, the market is a term used to describe the place where you can buy and sell shares of stocks, bonds, and other assets. To enter the market, don’t use your bank account.

You need to open an investment account, like a brokerage account, which you fund with cash that you can then use to buy stocks, bonds, and other investable assets. Big-name firms like Schwab or Fidelity will let you do this similarly to how you’d open a bank account.

Stocks vs. bonds: Publicly traded companies use the market to raise money for their operations, growth, or expansion by issuing stocks (small pieces of ownership of the company) or bonds (debt).

When a company issues bonds on the market, they are basically asking investors for loans to raise money for their organization. Investors buy the bonds, then the company pays them back, plus a percentage of interest, over time.

Stocks, on the other hand, are small pieces of equity in a company. When a company goes from private to public, its stock can be publicly bought and sold on the market — meaning it is no longer privately owned. A stock price is generally reflective of the value of the company, but the actual price is determined by what market participants are willing to pay or accept on any given day.

Other Types of Investments
You’re not limited to stocks and bonds, though. You can buy commodities, precious metals, investment real estate, or ...

Stocks are considered riskier investments than bonds because of this price volatility. If bad news comes out about a company, people may want to pay less to buy shares than they did before, which will lower the stock price. If you bought the stock for a large sum of money, you risk losing that money if the stock price drops.

Stocks are also riskier because when companies go bankrupt, bondholders receive their money back — stockholders have no such guarantee.

Making (and losing) money: In the market, you make or lose money depending on the purchase and sale price of whatever you buy. If you buy a stock at $10 and sell it at $15, you make $5. If you buy at $15 and sell at $10, you lose $5. Gains and losses are only “realized” or counted when you make the sale of the asset — so the stock you bought at $10 could drop to $6, but you’ll only “lose” the $4 if you sell the stock at $6. Maybe you wait a year and then sell the stock when it’s up to $11, thereby gaining $1 per share.

Are you investing reasonably?
Now that you understand how investing works, it’s time to think about where you want to put your money. As a rule of thumb, remember that the best risk an investor can take is a calculated one.

But how can you be calculated? How can you distinguish a smart investment from a risky investment? Truthfully, “smart” and “risky” are relative to every investor. Your circumstances (e.g., age, amount of debt, family status) or risk tolerance can help you identify where you fall on the risk spectrum.

In general, younger investors with many years before retirement should have riskier portfolios. That longer time horizon gives investors more years to weather the ups and downs of the market — and during their working years, investors are ideally just adding to their investment accounts rather than taking money out.

Someone at or near retirement, however, is much more vulnerable to changes in the market. If you use an investment account to cover your living expenses, you could be forced to take that money out of the account during a downturn in the market, which would not only shrink your portfolio but also could ensure significant investment losses.

A higher-risk portfolio would likely encompass a significant number of stocks and fewer (if any) bonds. As young investors grow older and need to reduce the risk in their portfolios, they should reduce their investment in stocks and increase their investment in bonds.

The ebb and flow of life will influence your investments more than you may realize. Being realistic about your current financial prospects will keep you clearheaded about where to invest your money.

Are you building wealth that lasts?
Larger-than-average returns almost always require you to take larger-than-average risks, and there are no free lunches in investing. As you work to build wealth and secure your financial future, stay focused on three long-term investment musts:

Build a “just in case” nest egg: Nearly one-quarter of Americans have no emergency savings. Don’t let yourself get caught in that trap. Retirement savings accounts are critical savings vehicles, but tapping into them before retirement typically brings steep tax penalties. To prevent this from happening, build an emergency fund — as described earlier — that amounts to roughly three to six months of your living expenses.

One of the most significant things you can do for your financial future is to make saving automatic — that is, have your bank automatically direct a portion of your paycheck into an account specifically for saving. This ensures you save consistently instead of forcing you to make an active choice to set money aside.

This sum should stay somewhere with low risk like a bank account, and it should remain liquid (i.e., cash or something else that’s always available to you) to ensure you can access it if you ever need it. Once you’ve established an emergency fund, invest future savings based on your risk tolerance.

Steer savings in the right direction: Generally, you’ll want to start by deciding what percentage of your assets you want to be in riskier assets (stocks/shares) and what percentage you want in safer assets (cash and bonds). This depends on your risk tolerance, as outlined above. Somebody young and working should be almost all in stocks, while somebody near retirement age should have a healthier allocation to bonds.

If you’re just starting to invest, I believe you should look at mutual funds or ETFs (i.e., a collection of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles) rather than individual stocks (i.e., ownership in only one company) because it will be easier to create a diversified account using funds if the account in question is small.

Diversification (owning a variety of assets) is important because it lessens the chance that your whole portfolio will lose value in a market downturn. You’ll want to find funds with solid track records and reasonable fees; plenty of popular press and dedicated research sites like Morningstar or Yahoo Finance will provide this information.

When you’re ready to start investing in individual stocks, you’ll want to do the same kind of research on any companies you consider: Do they have good track records? Do they have good management? Is the stock price reasonable? Does it add diversification to your portfolio, or is it similar to what you already hold? Spend some time on this step to ensure you’re making informed investment choices.

Make variety a theme of your investments: Diversifying across your entire investment “portfolio” (i.e., all of the investments you hold) is critical to building wealth because it allows you to manage risk more effectively. Stocks are one of the most talked-about investments, but you wouldn’t want to tie your entire financial future to the success of a single company — or even any broader market.

Depending on your financial circumstances and risk tolerance, you might want to consider investing in private equity, venture capital, precious metals, commodities, and real estate, all of which are available on the market. All these investments can be effective means to achieve portfolio diversification and manage risk.

Why? Because they rely on different underlying drivers. This means they generally operate in ways that are uncorrelated with each other and with more traditional investments like stocks and bonds, so they may be going up when stocks are going down.

A well-constructed portfolio should include several different types of assets (meaning stocks, bonds, etc.) that do not move in tandem. This reduces the volatility of a portfolio without necessarily lowering its return potential.

While these steps alone will not guarantee you complete financial independence, I believe they’re a great starting point. They can help you amass savings, achieve portfolio diversification, and empower you to start building wealth for a better financial future."
146,Not Misleading,"**Title: Beyond Numbers: A Holistic Approach to Selecting Investments**

Investing is an art as much as it is a science. While financial data and analysis are crucial, adopting a holistic perspective can lead to more well-rounded and successful investment decisions. In this article, we'll delve into an unconventional approach that takes into account the human element and a deep understanding of the world around you.

**1. Aligning with Personal Values: Investing with Purpose**
Consider investments that align with your values and beliefs. Ethical and sustainable investments not only offer potential financial gains but also a sense of contributing positively to society and the environment.

**2. Observing Consumer Behavior: Anticipating Trends**
Watch how people are changing their habits. This can provide insights into emerging market trends. Investing in sectors related to these shifts—such as renewable energy, remote work technologies, or health and wellness—can position you ahead of the curve.

**3. Local Engagement: Supporting Your Community**
Invest in local businesses and startups. Contributing to the growth of your community can have both financial and societal impacts. Attend local events, engage with entrepreneurs, and be part of the grassroots movement.

**4. Innovation and Disruption: Embracing Change**
Investing in innovative companies disrupting industries can yield significant returns. Keep an eye on technological advancements and invest in companies that are reshaping the landscape.

**5. Cultural and Demographic Insights: Tailoring to Trends**
Understand demographic shifts and cultural influences. For example, the aging population is creating opportunities in healthcare and senior services. Investing in areas that cater to changing demographics can be lucrative.

**6. Emotional Connection: Invest in What You Know**
Investing in industries you understand can provide a sense of security. If you have a hobby or a strong interest in a particular field, explore investment opportunities within that sector.

**7. Long-Term Vision: Patience Pays Off**
Rather than seeking quick gains, focus on investments that have long-term growth potential. This approach requires patience but can lead to more stable and substantial returns.

**8. Learning from Mistakes: Embracing Failure**
Not all investments will succeed. Rather than dwelling on losses, use them as opportunities for growth. Learn from your mistakes and adjust your strategies accordingly.

**9. Continuous Learning: Adapting to Change**
The investment landscape is dynamic. Stay curious and continue learning about new industries, technologies, and trends. This knowledge can guide you toward emerging opportunities.

**10. Emotional Intelligence: Managing Investor Psychology**
Understanding investor psychology can be a powerful tool. By recognizing common biases and emotional tendencies, you can make more rational and informed investment decisions.

In the world of investing, numbers are just one part of the equation. Embrace a holistic approach that integrates your values, understanding of trends, and emotional intelligence. By looking beyond the balance sheets, you can create a diversified portfolio that not only generates financial returns but also reflects your broader perspective on the world."
147,Not Misleading,"What Does It Mean To Manage Your Own Investments?
Managing your own investments may conjure thoughts of picking individual stocks and monitoring the market on a daily basis.

In reality, there’s a huge spectrum of what self-directed investing can mean, from day trading (most active) to putting every investment dollar into a single target date fund (most passive).

For most people, the passive end of the spectrum is the right choice. The more active you are, the more risk you take and the more variation you can expect with your results. Even a small move toward a more active investing style, such as buying non-index mutual funds, can cost you more money in fees.

Trusted sources, from money expert Clark Howard to famed investor Warren Buffett, recommend sticking to a tried-and-true, low-cost, long-term investment strategy.

Should You Manage Your Own Investments?
I’ve heard a lot of dismissive statements from financial professionals and media members about the ability of retail investors to handle their own investments.

The truth is that, especially in the first few decades of your career, if you’re already doing a good job managing your day-to-day finances, you probably don’t need help to manage your investments.

If you’re in your 20s or 30s and you’re ready to invest, money expert Clark Howard says you should put your money in a target date fund or in a mix of index funds (a total stock market fund, an international fund and a bond fund).

“Either of those options will give you complete diversification, and you didn’t need anybody to tell you how to do it or what to do,” Clark says. “You just need to put the money to work and put it on automatic pilot every pay period or every month. I mean, it’s all about just putting the money in. You don’t need a paid professional or a service. You just need to do it.”

That simple plan requires spending less money than you make and being disciplined over time. It doesn’t require picking stocks or being an investing genius. However, if you want to take a few chances with a small portion of your investments, there are more online educational resources and commission-free brokerage companies available than ever. The gap between Wall Street and Main Street has closed.

Lots of smart, financially savvy people use robo-advisors or full-service financial advisors. But if you’re willing to educate yourself and can be disciplined, you can manage your own investments. You may even have fun, make a good return and get satisfaction out of doing it.

Doing It Yourself? Clark’s Advice Still Applies
If you plan to manage your own investments, Clark has some good advice for you.

Build an emergency fund before you invest. Clark says you should have money set aside in a savings account for those inevitable unplanned expenses before putting your money into less liquid investments.
Invest most or all of your retirement dollars in a target date fund. Pick the year closest to when you plan to retire and put as much of your investment capital as possible into that fund.
Low-cost index funds are also good choices. If you really want to expand beyond the target date fund, Clark also likes low-cost ETFs and mutual funds that track broad indexes. He recommends a mix of total stock market, international and bond indexes.
Make regular, automated investment contributions. Investing is not a one-time, up-front action. Get in the habit of investing a portion of your pay automatically, either every paycheck or every month.
Increase the amount you’re contributing over time. Whether you start by putting aside five or 10 cents per dollar of income, try to increase that amount by one cent every six months.
Don’t make major moves because of big market fluctuations. It’s hard to predict when a market crash will stop. There’s a term for it: “trying to catch a falling knife.” It can be just as challenging to predict when a market will stop growing. Instead, focus on contributing your planned amount at regular intervals. As long as you’ve invested well, there’s no reason to sell or to buy during market shifts.
Advantages of Managing Your Own Investments
Here are some of the biggest benefits of handling your own investments:

You’ll pay the least amount of fees. This is the most inexpensive way to invest. If you pick one of the best investment companies, the only fees you’ll pay are expense ratios.
It’s easier than you think. Managing your own investments isn’t the same as pressing an “easy” button on your desk. But it can (and for most people, probably should) be simple.
It can be gratifying. The thru-hiking community (those who take on the Appalachian Trail, for example) have an interesting way of categorizing fun. There’s Type A, which is instant gratification and usually involves the senses. Think eating your favorite ice cream or sinking into a perfectly warmed hot tub. Then there’s Type B, which is delayed gratification. It usually involves hard work, but when you’re finished, you feel proud of what you’ve accomplished. Managing your own investments should fit into the Type B category along with things like running a marathon and fixing your own car.
You’ll be able to pick individual stocks. This doesn’t have to be the grave mistake that some would have you believe. Fractional shares and brokerages with zero account minimums make it possible to control the amount of money you invest in any specific asset. If you devote an appropriate percentage of your portfolio to an individual stock or stocks, you don’t have to feel guilty.
Disadvantages of Managing Your Own Investments
Here are some of the challenges of the do-it-yourself approach to investing:

You’ll incur greater risk. You’re almost always taking on more risk managing your own investments rather than paying a robo-advisor or financial advisor to handle them.
It’s potentially a lot more work. Even if you take a simple approach to managing your portfolio, it will take time, education, vigilance and discipline. Handing off those tasks to someone else can be a nice way to avoid stress.
Emotional discipline is a requirement. Not everyone has the stomach for long-term investing. When you’re watching your portfolio bleed money, whether it’s every minute, every day or every month, can you sit, watch and do nothing? Or will you be tempted to sell, which can cause you to miss out on huge market rebounds?
It’s easy to be overconfident. People tend to overestimate their abilities. I’ve done it. You’ve done it. In many cases, it’s not that we can’t do the task, but rather that we haven’t put in the time and effort to unlock our ability. There’s a good chance you have the tools you need to handle your own investments. But make sure you educate yourself before jumping into the investment deep end.
Alternatives To Self-Directed Investing
If you decide against managing your own investments, you can invest through a robo-advisor or hire a financial advisor.

What Is a Robo-Advisor?
A robo-advisor is an automated investment platform that puts your money into one of several pre-built portfolios based on your age, retirement timeline and risk tolerance. The portfolios typically rely on low-cost ETFs and mutual funds in addition to bonds and other means of diversification.

Good robo-advisors charge an annual fee in the neighborhood of 0.25% plus the expense ratios of the underlying funds, which tend to be less than 0.2%. Robo-advisors aren’t designed to beat the market long term, but they do a nice job of alleviating risk and aiming for steady returns over time.

What Is a Financial Advisor?
A financial advisor is a paid professional who gives you financial planning advice and helps manage your money. He or she can serve as a coach, counselor and even concierge at various times.

Good financial advisors assess your debts, assets and goals, then work with you to create a comprehensive financial plan. In addition to managing your investments, they can work on your tax strategy, retirement plan and more.

There’s an unofficial benchmark cost of 1% for financial advisors in 2023. In reality, the price varies widely. But the all-in costs are often slightly more than 1%.

There are financial advisors with several different titles, qualifications and compensation structures, so it’s important to understand how to find and choose a financial advisor.

Final Thoughts
Avoiding exorbitant fees is important whether you handle your own investing or outsource it. Take the time to do your research and find a reasonably-priced option.

If you opt to invest on your own, Clark’s two recommendations, a target date fund or a blend of low-cost index funds, accomplish this goal.

But remember, if you outsource your portfolio, it doesn’t absolve you of responsibility. You still need to be mindful of fees. And you still need to avoid making big investment decisions out of emotion.

However you chose to invest, be sure to contribute new money regularly so that you’re putting enough money aside to retire. The best time to get started is now."
148,Not Misleading,"**Title: The Curious Investor's Guide: Unconventional Strategies for Choosing Investments**

In the fast-paced world of finance, the landscape of investment options continues to evolve. To navigate this dynamic terrain, investors must be willing to think outside the box and explore innovative strategies. In this article, we'll dive into unconventional yet effective approaches for selecting investments that stand out in the crowd.

**1. Storytelling Investments: Investing in Narratives**
Look for companies with compelling narratives that resonate with societal trends and aspirations. By investing in businesses that tell a story people want to be a part of, you can tap into emotional connections and potentially ride the wave of collective enthusiasm.

**2. Cultural Currency: Embracing Pop Culture Trends**
Stay attuned to popular culture and consumer trends. Invest in companies that reflect shifts in lifestyle, preferences, and entertainment. From gaming and streaming to emerging fashion movements, cultural currency can translate into financial gains.

**3. Retro Revivals: Nostalgia as an Investment Strategy**
Nostalgia is a powerful force. Consider investing in brands and products that evoke sentimental value for consumers. Retro revivals often captivate multiple generations, creating a broad market appeal.

**4. Technological Adoption Curve: Riding the Wave**
Study the adoption curve of emerging technologies. Invest in companies positioned at the tipping point of widespread acceptance. Early investments in innovative tech can yield significant rewards as trends go mainstream.

**5. Collaborative Economy Investments: Shared Success**
Look into investments that thrive on collaboration. Sharing economy platforms, co-working spaces, and collaborative consumption models can capitalize on changing behaviors and preferences.

**6. Health and Wellness Innovation: Well-Being Focus**
Invest in companies that prioritize health and wellness. The increasing awareness of holistic well-being presents opportunities in areas such as organic foods, fitness technologies, mental health support, and mindfulness apps.

**7. Space Exploration and Beyond: Investing in the Stars**
With advancements in space exploration, consider investing in companies pushing the boundaries of aerospace technology. As the cosmos becomes more accessible, the investment potential is astronomical.

**8. Micro-Moments Investments: Catering to Convenience**
In the era of instant gratification, invest in companies that cater to micro-moments—quick and convenient solutions that address everyday needs. From food delivery to app-based services, convenience is a driving force.

**9. The Experience Economy: Investing in Memories**
Look beyond traditional products and invest in experiences. From travel and entertainment to immersive events, the experience economy offers a unique way to tap into consumer desires.

**10. Sustainable Innovations: Green Investments**
Environmental consciousness is shaping consumer preferences. Invest in companies leading the way in sustainable practices, renewable energy, and eco-friendly technologies.

In a world of constant change and disruption, embracing unconventional strategies can lead to exciting investment opportunities. By combining financial analysis with a keen understanding of cultural shifts, emerging technologies, and evolving consumer behaviors, you can identify investments that have the potential to offer both financial rewards and a sense of connection to the world around us."
149,Not Misleading,"The biggest misconception about investing is that it’s reserved for the rich.

That might’ve been true in the past. But that barrier to entry is gone today, knocked down by companies and services that have made it their mission to make investment options available for everyone, including beginners and those who have just small amounts of money to put to work.

In fact, with so many investments now available to beginners, there’s no excuse to skip out. And that’s good news, because investing can be a great way to grow your wealth.

The best investments for beginners
1. A 401(k) or other employer retirement plan
If you have a 401(k) or another retirement plan at work, it’s very likely the first place to consider putting your money — especially if your company matches a portion of your contributions. That match is free money and a guaranteed return on your investment.

You can start with as little as 1% of each paycheck, though it’s a good rule of thumb to try to contribute enough to get your employer match. For example, a common matching arrangement is 50% of the first 6% of your salary you contribute. To capture the full match in that scenario, you would have to contribute 6% of your salary each year. But you can work your way up to that over time.

Most 401(k) contributions are made pretax. That means, when you elect to contribute to a 401(k), the money will go directly from your paycheck into the account without ever making it to your bank. Some 401(k)s today will place your funds by default in a target-date fund — more on those below — but you may have other choices. Here’s how to invest in your 401(k).

To sign up for your 401(k) or learn more about your specific plan, contact your HR department.

2. A robo-advisor
Maybe you’re on this page to eat your peas, so to speak: You know you’re supposed to invest, you’ve managed to save some money to do so, but you would really rather wash your hands of the whole situation.

There’s good news: You largely can, thanks to robo-advisors. These services manage your investments for you using computer algorithms. Due to low overhead, they charge low fees relative to human investment managers — a robo-advisor typically costs 0.25% to 0.50% of your account balance per year, and many allow you to open an account with no minimum.

They’re a great way for beginners to get started investing because they often require very little money and they do most of the work for you. That’s not to say you shouldn’t keep eyes on your account — this is your money; you never want to be completely hands-off — but a robo-advisor will do the heavy lifting.

And if you’re interested in learning how to invest, but you need a little help getting up to speed, robo-advisors can help there, too. It’s useful to see how the service constructs a portfolio and what investments are used. Some services also offer educational content and tools, and a few even allow you to customize your portfolio to a degree if you wish to experiment a bit in the future.

3. Target-date mutual funds
These are kind of like the robo-advisor of yore, though they’re still widely used and incredibly popular, especially in employer retirement plans. Target-date mutual funds are retirement investments that automatically invest with your estimated retirement year in mind.

Let’s back up a little and explain what a mutual fund is: essentially, a basket of investments. Investors buy a share in the fund and in doing so, they invest in all of the fund’s holdings with one transaction.

A professional manager typically chooses how the fund is invested, but there will be some kind of general theme: For example, a U.S. equity mutual fund will invest in U.S. stocks (also called equities).

A target-date mutual fund often holds a mix of stocks and bonds. If you plan to retire in about 30 years, you could choose a target-date fund with 2050 or 2055 in the name. That fund will initially hold mostly stocks since your retirement date is far away, and stock returns tend to be higher over the long term.

Over time, it will slowly shift some of your money toward bonds, following the general guideline that you want to take a bit less risk as you approach retirement.

4. Index funds
Index funds are like mutual funds on autopilot: Rather than employing a professional manager to build and maintain the fund’s portfolio of investments, index funds track a market index.

A market index is a selection of investments that represent a portion of the market. For example, the S&P 500 is a market index that holds the stocks of roughly 500 of the largest companies in the U.S. An S&P 500 index fund would aim to mirror the performance of the S&P 500, buying the stocks in that index.

Because index funds take a passive approach to investing by tracking a market index rather than using professional portfolio management, they tend to carry lower expense ratios — a fee charged based on the amount you have invested — than mutual funds. But like mutual funds, investors in index funds are buying a chunk of the market in one transaction.

Index funds can have minimum investment requirements, but some brokerage firms, including Fidelity and Charles Schwab, offer a selection of index funds with no minimum. That means you can begin investing in an index fund for less than $100.

5. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
ETFs operate in many of the same ways as index funds: They typically track a market index and take a passive approach to investing. They also tend to have lower fees than mutual funds. Just like an index fund, you can buy an ETF that tracks a market index such as the S&P 500.

The main difference between ETFs and index funds is that rather than carrying a minimum investment, ETFs are traded throughout the day and investors buy them for a share price, which like a stock price, can fluctuate. That share price is essentially the ETF’s investment minimum, and depending on the fund, it can range from under $100 to $300 or more.

Because ETFs are traded like stocks, brokers used to charge a commission to buy or sell them. The good news: Most brokers have dropped trading costs to $0 for ETFs. If you plan to regularly invest in an ETF — as many investors do, by making automatic investments each month or week — consider a commission-free ETF so you aren’t paying a commission each time.

6. Investment apps
Several investing apps target beginner investors.

One is Acorns, which rounds up your purchases on linked debit or credit cards and invests the change in a diversified portfolio of ETFs. On that end, it works like a robo-advisor, managing that portfolio for you. There is no minimum to open an Acorns account, and the service will start investing for you once you’ve accumulated at least $5 in round-ups. You can also make lump-sum deposits.

Another app option is Stash, which helps teach beginner investors how to build their own portfolios out of ETFs and individual stocks. Stash also offers a managed portfolio.

Why investing is important
You might have heard someone reminisce about how cheap gas prices (or some other product or service) used to be back in the day. This is because inflation erodes the value of money as years go by.

By investing, you can better combat inflation, increasing your chances of being able to afford the same amount of goods and services in the future that you can today.

Investing helps you make your money work for you because of compounding. Compound earnings means that any returns you earn are reinvested to earn additional returns. And the earlier you start investing, the more potential benefit you gain from compounding.

Never done it before? Here's what to consider
If you're a beginner to investing, there are some things to think about before you jump in.

Your goals and time horizon
Consider what goal you are wanting to achieve by investing and your time horizon, the length of time you have to invest before reaching that goal. If the time horizon to your goal is short, investing might not be the best solution for you. Check out our article on how to invest for short-term or long-term goals.

Risk tolerance and diversification
All investments have some level of risk and the market is volatile, it moves up and down over time. It's important for you to understand your personal risk tolerance. This means gauging how comfortable you are with risk or how much volatility you can handle.

When investing, a good rule of thumb is not to put all of your eggs in one basket. Instead, diversify. By spreading your dollars across various investments, you can reduce investment risk. This is why the investments we outline below use mutual funds or exchange-traded funds for the most part, which allows investors to purchase baskets of securities instead of individual stocks and bonds.

The bottom line on investing for beginners
Time waits for no one — and neither does inflation. That's why it's a good idea to consider compounding your money by investing.

As a beginner, investing can sound intimidating — but by setting goals and a time horizon, you can make it easier. And with diversification, you can make it a bit safer. If you're interested in investing, retirement plans, robo-advisors, funds and investment apps are all places to consider.

But before making any investment, it’s important for new investors to know what their tolerance is for risk. Certain investments carry more risk than others and you don’t want to be surprised after you’ve made the investment. Think about how long you can do without the money you’ll be investing and whether you’re comfortable not accessing it for a few years or longer.

Here are some top investment ideas for those just starting out.

Best investments for beginners
1. High-yield savings accounts
This can be one of the simplest ways to boost the return on your money above what you’re earning in a typical checking account. High-yield savings accounts, which are often opened through an online bank, tend to pay higher interest on average than standard savings accounts while still giving customers regular access to their money.

This can be a great place to park money you’re saving for a purchase in the next couple years or just holding in case of an emergency.

2. Certificates of deposit (CDs)
CDs are another way to earn additional interest on your savings, but they will tie up your money for longer than a high-yield savings account. You can purchase a CD for different time periods such as six months, one year or even five years, but you typically can’t access the money before the CD matures without paying a penalty.

These are considered extremely safe and if you purchase one through a federally insured bank, you’re covered up to $250,000 per depositor, per ownership category.

3. 401(k) or another workplace retirement plan
This can be one of the simplest ways to get started in investing and comes with some major incentives that could benefit you now and in the future. Most employers offer to match a portion of what you agree to save for retirement out of your regular paycheck. If your employer offers a match and you don’t participate in the plan, you are turning down free money.

In a traditional 401(k), the contributions are made prior to being taxed and grow tax-free until retirement age. Some employers offer Roth 401(k)s, which allow contributions to be made after taxes. If you select this option, you won’t pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.

These workplace retirement plans are great savings tools because they’re automatic once you’ve made your initial selections, and allow you to consistently invest over time. Often, you can even choose to invest in target-date mutual funds, which manage their portfolios based on a specific retirement date. As you get closer to the target date, the fund’s allocation will shift away from riskier assets to account for a shorter investment horizon.

4. Mutual funds
Mutual funds give investors the opportunity to invest in a basket of stocks or bonds (or other assets) that they might not be able to easily build on their own.

The most popular mutual funds track indexes such as the S&P 500, which is comprised of around 500 of the largest companies in the U.S. Index funds usually come with very low fees for the funds’ investors, and occasionally no fee at all. These low costs help investors keep more of the funds’ returns for themselves and can be a great way to build wealth over time.

5. ETFs
Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are similar to mutual funds in that they hold a basket of securities, but they trade throughout the day in the same way a stock would. ETFs do not come with the same minimum investment requirements as mutual funds, which typically come in at a few thousand dollars. ETFs can be purchased for the cost of one share plus any fees or commissions associated with the purchase, though you can get started with even less if your broker allows fractional share investing.

Both ETFs and mutual funds are ideal assets to hold in tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.

6. Individual stocks
Buying stocks in individual companies is the riskiest investment option discussed here, but it can also be one of the most rewarding. But before you start making trades, you should consider whether buying a stock makes sense for you. Ask yourself if you are investing for the long-term, which generally means at least five years, and whether you understand the business you are investing in. Stocks are priced every second of the trading day and because of that, people often get drawn into the short-term trading mentality when they own individual stocks.

But a stock is a partial ownership stake in a real business and over time your fortune will rise with that of the underlying company you invested in. If you don’t feel you have the expertise or stomach to ride it out with individual stocks, consider taking the more diversified approach offered by mutual funds or ETFs instead.

Why should you start investing?
Investing is crucial if you want to maintain the purchasing power of your savings and reach long-term financial goals like retirement or building wealth. If you let your savings sit in a traditional bank account earning little or no interest, eventually inflation will decrease the value of your hard-earned cash. By investing in assets like stocks and bonds, you can make sure your savings keeps up with inflation or even outpaces it.

Short-term investments like high-yield savings accounts or money market mutual funds can help you earn more on your savings while you work towards a big purchase such as a car or a down payment on a house. Stocks and ETFs are considered better for long-term goals like retirement because they are more likely to earn better returns over time, but they carry additional risk.

Important considerations for new investors
Risk tolerance: Before you start investing, you’ll want to understand your own tolerance for risk. Volatile investments such as stocks can make some people very uncomfortable when they decline, which can cause you to sell at the worst possible time. Knowing your risk tolerance will help you choose which investments are best suited for you.
Financial goals: Establish both short- and long-term goals that you want to achieve through saving and investing. Understanding your investment goals will help you develop a solid plan.
Active or passive: You’ll also need to decide if you’d like to be a passive investor or an active one. A passive investor typically owns an asset like diversified mutual funds or ETFs that charge low fees, while an active investor might choose individual investments or mutual funds that aim to outperform the market. Studies have shown that passive investing tends to outperform active investing over time.
Do-it-yourself or hire someone: You can also choose to manage your own investments through an online broker, or hire a financial advisor (or robo-advisor) to help you out. You’ll likely incur lower costs if you do it yourself, but an advisor can be helpful for those just starting out.
Taxes: If you own investments in an individual or joint account, you’ll likely need to pay taxes on the interest, dividends and capital gains you earn. You can avoid these taxes by owning investments in tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as an IRA.
How much money is needed to start investing?
The good news is that you don’t need much money to start investing. Most online brokers have no account minimums to get started and some offer fractional share investing for those starting with small dollar amounts. For just a few dollars you can purchase ETFs that allow you to build a diversified portfolio of stocks. Micro-investing platforms will even let you round up purchases made through a debit card as a way to get started with investing.

Bottom line
If you’re just starting out in the investment world, make sure to consider your risk tolerance and what your financial goals are before committing money to an investment. Some investments, like high-yield savings accounts, allow for quick access to money if emergencies come up. Meanwhile stocks should probably be part of a long-term investment plan instead.

Many beginning investors also turn to robo-advisors, where an algorithm automatically selects and manages a diversified portfolio of exchange-traded funds for you, based around your individual financial needs and appetite for risk."
151,Not Misleading,"**Title: Investing 101: A Beginner's Guide to Building Wealth**

Investing might seem daunting for beginners, but it's a crucial step toward securing your financial future. In this article, we'll break down the essentials of investing and provide you with a solid foundation to start your journey towards building wealth.

**1. The Power of Compounding: Start Early**
Compounding is your best friend in investing. It's the process where your initial investment earns returns, and those returns, in turn, generate more returns. Starting early allows compounding to work its magic over a longer period.

**2. Set Clear Financial Goals: Define Your Purpose**
Before you begin investing, determine your financial objectives. Are you saving for retirement, buying a home, funding education, or simply growing your wealth? Having clear goals will guide your investment choices.

**3. Understand Risk Tolerance: Finding Your Comfort Zone**
Investments come with risks. Assess your risk tolerance, or how comfortable you are with the possibility of losing money. Different investments carry different levels of risk, so it's important to find the right balance for your comfort.

**4. Start with the Basics: Diversification**
Diversification means not putting all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Diversification helps reduce the impact of a single investment's poor performance on your overall portfolio.

**5. Investment Vehicles: Exploring Options**
Explore different investment options like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Each comes with its own risk-reward profile, so it's important to understand what suits your goals.

**6. Invest in What You Know: Stay Familiar**
Especially as a beginner, consider investing in companies or industries you're familiar with. If you're a tech enthusiast, for instance, researching and investing in tech companies might align with your interests and expertise.

**7. Start Small and Consistent: Dollar-Cost Averaging**
You don't need a huge lump sum to start investing. Consider dollar-cost averaging, where you invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy minimizes the impact of market volatility on your investments.

**8. Educate Yourself: Knowledge is Key**
Take the time to learn about investing. Understand financial terms, read books, follow reputable financial news sources, and consider taking online courses to enhance your understanding.

**9. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Stay Rational**
Investing can be emotional, especially during market fluctuations. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or greed. Stick to your investment plan and focus on your long-term goals.

**10. Seek Professional Guidance: Consult a Financial Advisor**
If you're unsure about where to start, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor. They can provide personalized guidance based on your goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation.

Remember, investing is a journey, not a destination. It requires patience, learning, and adaptability. By starting early, setting clear goals, diversifying your investments, and continuously educating yourself, you're well on your way to building a strong financial future."

But investing can seem scary and intimidating, especially to first-time investors.

Best investments to get started
Just getting started with investing and wondering how to earn money on your savings? Here are a few ways to get started.

High-yield savings account (HYSA)
If you want higher returns on your money but are nervous about investing, consider opening a high-yield savings account. An HYSA offers a much higher APY than a traditional savings account, which allows you to maximize your return on your money without the risk of investing it.

When you’re looking for an HYSA, it’s a good idea to shop around. Different financial institutions, such as CIT Accelerated Savings, will offer different APYs, but an account with the highest APY isn’t necessarily the best choice. Read the terms of each HYSA you’re considering carefully, looking for information about minimum balances or annual fees to help you find the best HYSA.


401(k)
Many U.S. employers offer a 401(k) retirement plan as part of their benefits package. With a 401(k), you will have a certain percentage of your pay held back as a contribution—it can be pre-tax or post-tax, depending on the type of account. A traditional 401(k) contribution is pre-tax, which will decrease your taxable income but means you’ll pay taxes when withdrawing funds at retirement. Contributions for a Roth 401(k) are taxed upfront, which means you won’t owe taxes on your money when you reach retirement age. 

Your employer may offer a matching contribution up to a certain percentage of your salary—for example, if you make $50,000 and your employer offers a 100 percent match for the first 6 percent you contribute, your employer will contribute $3,000 per year, provided you also contribute at least that amount. The maximum employee contribution amount for the 2023 tax year is $22,500. 

If you are self-employed or your employer doesn’t offer a 401(k), look into the following options:

Traditional or Roth IRA
SEP IRA
Simple IRA or Simple 401(k)
Solo 401(k)
Short-term certificates of deposit (CD)
A certificate of deposit is a type of savings account that offers a higher APY than a traditional savings account. With a CD, you deposit a lump sum of cash for an agreed-upon time frame. During the account term, you cannot access the funds without paying a penalty. Once the CD reaches maturity, you can withdraw or deposit the funds into a new one.

CD terms range between 6 months and 5 years. Longer-term CDs usually have a higher APY. But you can find some short-term no penalty CDs like CIT's 11-month no penalty CD. CDs from federally insured banks are covered up to $250,000 per customer.

Money market accounts (MMA)
Another low-risk option is a money market account - another type of savings account with a higher APY than a traditional one. MMAs have additional benefits, such as a debit card or check-writing capabilities, which means you can access the money when needed. U.S. Bank offers a competitive money market account option that allows for easy access to your funds through a debit card or check-writing capabilities, while also earning a higher Annual Percentage Yield (APY) than a traditional savings account for low-risk saving.

Mutual funds
Rather than putting your money into individual funds, consider investing in a mutual fund. A mutual fund is a group of investments you buy a share of, and a manager determines where to invest the money. This helps you diversify your investments and avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. When you’re young, you’ll likely have more money in stocks, which are higher risk but have a more considerable long-term earning potential. As you near retirement age, your investment mix will change to mostly bonds, which are lower risk and can help guarantee you’ll have a steady income at retirement. Choosing a target-date mutual fund allows you to determine your retirement date so that the fund will focus mainly on stocks when you’re younger and move toward bonds as you creep closer to retirement.

Index funds
Index funds are similar to mutual funds. However, rather than a manager determining where to invest the funds, an index fund will invest money within a specific market index. For example, an S&P 500 index fund would purchase stocks within this market index, which includes around 500 of the best-performing companies in the U.S. Index funds often have a minimum investment requirement. However, some well-known brokerage platforms, such as J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing*, generally allow you to invest money in an index fund without a minimum (and you can earn up to $700 when an account is opened and funded with a J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing).

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are similar to index funds that track a specific market index like the S&P 500. The difference is that ETFs are bought and sold throughout the day, and investors buy them for a fluctuating share price—just like individual stocks on a stock exchange. ETFs are typically cheaper to purchase and manage than mutual funds; some brokerage firms offer them at $0 commission.

Stocks
Investing in individual stocks can be risky—but it can pay off in the long run if you do it right. When you buy stocks, you’re essentially buying an ownership stake in a business. By purchasing stock at the right time (such as when a business is just starting out and shows a lot of potential), you can grow your wealth alongside the company. If you’ve never purchased stock before, it can seem intimidating; however, you can use paper trades to practice investing in stocks. Paper trades allow you to learn how to invest in stocks risk-free since you don’t actually use any money, so by the time you’re ready to invest you’ll be comfortable with the process.

Tools to use
As you’re starting out, you may want to try some of the electronic tools that let you test out the market at a low cost.

Robo-advisors
A robo-advisor is an algorithmically powered advisor that invests money on your behalf based on your goals. This option lets you be hands-off with your investing, making them ideal for first-time investors. Robo-advisors charge a lower commission than a traditional advisor or broker, making them ideal for beginners. For example, M1 Finance automates your wealth in one place that’s accessible via website or app. You will identify your goals and make your own financial decisions, and M1 Finance will automate your strategy to help you reach those goals. M1 doesn’t charge any monthly fees, but it does have a minimum balance fee of $50 and will charge for paper copies of tax documents, statements, and other documents. You’ll also pay regulatory expenses, which are typically just a few pennies when you sell a stock or an ETF.

Investment apps
Another good option for beginners are investment apps. Using these apps, you can deposit money by scheduling recurring transfers or linking your debit or credit card and rounding up. Acorns allows you to connect your card and automatically round up transactions to the nearest dollar, depositing the change in your account. Once you reach $5, the app acts as a robo-advisor and invests your money in ETFs. It’s a hands-off approach that works well if you’re looking to dip your toes in and try out investing without committing a large sum of money. Tradestation Trading Platform, which is renowned for its comprehensive suite of advanced trading tools, comes at a $0 account minimum requirement, and $0 per trade up to 10,000 shares.

Brokerage firm
If you don’t like the idea of using an app or a robo-advisor, consider working with a stockbroker through a brokerage firm. While an investment website can only offer limited options, a live broker can help you determine the best places to invest based on your goals. They can also advise you on the best types of investments for you, and then keep track of those investments and advise you about buying or selling stocks. This service comes at a price, though; stockbrokers typically make commission on their clients’ transactions. Ask about a brokerage firm’s profit model and commission percentage before hiring them so you can estimate how much you’ll pay.

Key considerations for beginners
Knowing your options is one thing, but you might still wonder how to start investing your money. Before beginning your investing journey, take the time to consider your short- and long-term financial goals, your risk tolerance, and the amount of money you have to invest.

Determine your goals
What do you want to achieve with your investments? Are you saving for retirement or a significant expense, such as a down payment on a home or a new car? Determining your goals and whether they are short-term or long-term will help point you in the right direction. For example, if you want to maximize your long-term earnings to ensure a comfortable retirement, consider looking into mutual funds or IRAs. But if you have a short-term goal, such as a dream vacation you’re planning in two years, stashing your money in a CD could be a better option. 

If you’re unsure of your goals, a financial advisor can help point you in the right direction. Ask friends or family members for recommendations, or use a tool such as WiserAdvisor or SmartAsset to find the best financial advisors to help you identify and reach your goals.

Consider your risk tolerance
When you first start investing, you might be nervous that you’ll lose a chunk of money if you invest in the wrong stocks. That’s why it’s essential to consider your risk tolerance. Low-risk investments like HYSEs, CDs, or MMAs are good options because they give you a guaranteed return on investment. However, if you stick with these low-risk options, you stand to make much less money over time than if you invested in the stock market. A financial advisor can help guide you toward investments that match your risk tolerance level.

Consider minimum amounts
The minimum investment amount will depend on your choice of investment vehicle. Luckily, you can start investing in stocks with a relatively small amount of money—possibly as little as $10 with some brokerages. Ask about minimum investment amounts as part of your research to ensure the option you choose doesn’t require you to deposit more money than you’re comfortable with.

Diversify your investments
When you invest your money, it’s essential to cast your net wide. Throwing all your money into one company’s stock might seem like a good move, but if that company’s stock prices fall, your investment will quickly lose its value. Investing in index funds, or ETFs, allows you to diversify your investments, which is a much safer bet in the long run. 

Picking the right diversification strategy can be tough for beginners, but YieldStreet offers tools and educational content to guide you. Another excellent platform to use if you are retiring and want diversify your assets is Rocket Dollar.

How to pick the best investment vehicle as a beginner
Deciding on the best investment vehicle can be tricky, even if you think you understand your options. Once you’ve identified your goals and risk tolerance, consider consulting financial advisors to point you in the right direction. They can use their experience and knowledge of the stock market to help you identify the best options for your money.

Make your move
The best investment options will be different for everyone. That’s why it’s important to learn about your options and consider the ones that will help you meet your financial goals. Speaking to a professional can help guide your decision, but you must make the final call based on your comfort level. 

Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
You probably have many questions if you’re looking into the best investments for beginners. The following are a few common questions about investing that can help you understand how to make the best financial decisions.

How can I make money without investing in stocks?
If you don’t want to invest your money in the stock market, you have several options to get a return on your money. The lowest-risk options include a high-yield savings account, certificate of deposit, or money market account. You can also look into purchasing real estate as an investment, buying into a franchise, or even investing in precious metals like gold or silver. However, these options require a substantial sum of money before investing, whereas you can open an HYSE, CD, or MMA with a smaller cash deposit.

What are non-financial investment types?
When considering the best place to invest your money, you might come across the term “non-financial assets.” This term refers to an asset, such as land or real estate, that isn’t traded on the stock market. Other examples include investing in natural resources or patents.

What are the best low-risk investments?
The best low-risk investments are not technically investments at all. Putting your money into a high-yield savings account, certificate of deposit, or money market account will get you a better return on your money than a traditional savings account. However, you won’t get as high a return on your investment by stashing your money into one of these options as you would be likely to get by investing it. Speaking to a financial advisor can help you decide which option will get you the most for your money while giving you peace of mind that you won’t lose everything if the market crashes.

154,Not Misleading,"When Should I Start Investing?
First things first. Before you start investing, you need to work your way through the first three of Ramsey’s 7 Baby Steps. That means saving $1,000 for a starter emergency fund, paying off all your debt except your mortgage using the debt snowball method, and then saving a fully funded emergency fund of 3–6 months of expenses.

If you’re new to the 7 Baby Steps, no problem! Simply put, it’s a plan millions of people have followed to get out of debt and start building wealth for retirement. Let’s break it down:

Step 1: Save $1,000 for your starter emergency fund.
Step 2: Pay off all debt (except the house) using the debt snowball.
Step 3: Save 3–6 months of expenses in a fully funded emergency fund.
Step 4: Invest 15% of your household income in retirement.
Step 5: Save for your kids’ college fund.
Step 6: Pay off your home early.
Step 7: Build wealth and give generously!
Here’s the deal—your income is your most important wealth-building tool. And as long as it’s tied up in monthly debt payments, you can’t build wealth. It’s like trying to fill a bucket with water when there’s a hole on the bottom—it just doesn’t work.

By building a debt-free foundation and stashing a good chunk of savings in the bank, you’re setting yourself up to build wealth the right way.

When you reach Baby Step 4, start putting 15% of your household income into tax-advantaged retirement accounts, like your 401(k) at work or Roth IRAs. With your income freed up from debt payments, you’ll be able to throw that 15% at your retirement without blinking an eye.

Tackle Baby Steps 1–3 in order—put all your focus and energy on one financial goal at a time. But when you reach Baby Steps 4, 5 and 6, you can invest in retirement, save for college, and pay off your mortgage all at the same time. Why? Because you crushed your debt and freed up your income! And now you’re on the road to building real wealth.

In fact, there’s a whole group of millionaires called Baby Steps Millionaires who’ve followed the 7 Baby Steps to hit the million-dollar mark. They were able to pay off all their debt and reach a million-dollar net worth in about 20 years.

How to Start Investing in 5 Steps
Starting anything new can be intimidating—especially when it’s something that can have long-term effects on your finances—but don’t give up. Anyone can invest—including you. And it’s okay if you have a ton of questions. Here are five easy-to-follow steps to help you get started.


1. Decide on Your Investing Goals
We’ve always said one of the keys to following the 7 Baby Steps and getting out of debt is knowing your why. Why are you getting out of debt? What’s the big, specific goal you have that’s driving you to kick debt to curb? Having a definite reason for getting out of debt gives you a finish line to look forward to in your race to financial freedom.

Market chaos, inflation, your future—work with a pro to navigate this stuff.

That’s also true for investing—a key to starting your investing journey on the right foot is being clear about your goals. Why do you want to start investing? Is it to build your retirement? To pay for your kids’ or grandkids’ college? To save a down payment for your first house?

Getting clear on why you want to invest your hard-earned money will help you with the next step, which is to . . .

2. Understand Your Investing Options
Before you dive into investing, it’s important to take a step back and look at all your options.

Different types of investing accounts (like IRAs or 529 plans) are made for different investing goals. You’ll also have different types of investments (like stocks, bonds or mutual funds) to choose from for those accounts.

So check out these common types of investing accounts for long-term savings (like building retirement) and short-term savings (like saving for a down payment) and see which one might work for you:

Saving for Retirement
Whether you’re self-employed, a small-business owner, or you work for an employer who offers a retirement plan as part of their benefits package, there’s plenty of investing accounts to help you start saving for retirement. These are the highlights of each type, but always talk to an investing pro to get all the details:

Traditional or Roth 401(k)

Many employers offer their employees either a traditional 401(k) or Roth 401(k) as part of their benefits package. They’re both retirement savings plans, but there’s one major difference—how they’re taxed.

With a traditional 401(k), your money goes in tax-deferred. In other words, you’ll get a tax break now, but you will owe the IRS taxes once you start using the money in retirement. That also includes taxes on any employer contributions and—you guessed it—taxes on all the growth of your contributions as well.

With a Roth 401(k), your contributions are taxed up front. But when you start withdrawing at retirement, you won’t owe Uncle Sam any taxes on those contributions or their growth. The only thing you’ll still owe taxes on is any employer contributions. Sweet!

Traditional or Roth IRA

An individual retirement account (IRA) is similar to a 401(k) because it lets you invest for retirement with some special tax advantages—either a tax deduction now with tax-deferred growth (a traditional IRA) or tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement (a Roth IRA, the rock star of retirement accounts).

But unlike a 401(k), an IRA isn’t sponsored by your employer. And that’s a good thing! That means you usually have thousands more options when it comes to choosing your mutual fund investments.

SIMPLE IRA or SEP IRA

If you’re a small-business owner, a SIMPLE IRA plan makes it easy to save for your own retirement while also contributing to your employees’ retirement savings.

As of 2023, employees can save up to $15,500 in the plan per year (anyone age 50 and older can put in an extra $3,500 as a catch-up contribution) and the employer usually has to offer up to a 3% match for their employees every year.1

A simplified employee pension (SEP IRA) is another retirement plan option for small-business owners or self-employed people that offers many of the major tax advantages of a traditional IRA. 

Unlike a SIMPLE IRA, which lets employers and employees to contribute to the plan, only employers are allowed to contribute to SEP IRAs on behalf of their employees. For 2023, employers can put up to 25% of an employee’s salary into their account each year, up to a total contribution of $66,000.2

Saving for Education
Once you’re investing 15% of your income for retirement, you’re ready to start saving for your children’s college fund. Remember, your retirement comes first.

Let’s take a look at your investing options for college savings and why we recommend them (or not):

529 Savings Plan

Named after its section in the IRS code, a 529 plan is a state-run tax-advantaged account that lets you set aside money for educational expenses. It’s a great option if your investing goal is to save for your child or grandchild’s future college.

There are lots of 529 plans, but the two most common are savings plans and prepaid plans. Stay away from a prepaid plan. They have a lot of restrictions, including how you can use the money (expensive textbooks or housing are off the table).

A 529 savings plan, on the other hand, is a great choice for college savings. There’s no age limit for contributions or distributions. If your 30-year-old decides to go back to school, they can still use the money in the account. And thanks to the Secure 2.0 Act, you can roll over any unused money from a 529 savings plan into a Roth IRA for the plan’s beneficiary (if you meet several qualifications).3

Education Savings Account (ESA)

An ESA (sometimes called a Coverdell ESA) is a trust or custodial account that lets you invest money to pay for someone else’s education.

ESAs are different from 529 plans in a few important ways—first, ESAs have a contribution limit of $2,000 per child per year, while there’s virtually no limit on 529 plan contributions. And with an ESA, you can choose almost any kind of investment, including stocks, bonds, and our number one recommendation, mutual funds. Having more control over your investments while saving so your kiddos don’t have to take out student loans? Sounds like a win-win to us!

Before deciding on an ESA or 529 plan for your college savings, talk with an investing pro who can answer any questions you have about tax implications, rollover rules, and income and age qualifications for you as the investor and for the students you’re saving for.

Short-Term Saving
If you’ve started putting 15% of your household income into retirement and are looking for ways to save money short-term, here are some of your best options:

Index Funds

Index funds are a type of mutual fund designed to mirror a market index like the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500. That makes them relatively low risk and predictable.

Index funds will give you an average rate of return based on stock market conditions. But like with all investing, the longer you keep your money in an index fund, the more likely you are to see growth. That makes them a great option for growing your savings for a down payment or buying your first rental property as long as you’re not planning to use that money for at least five years.

Money Market Account

A money market account (MMA), also known as a money market deposit account or money market savings account, is a great option for low-risk, short-term savings.

An MMA usually pays a better interest rate than you’d get with a regular savings account, and another perk of an MMA is its liquidity (that’s banker-speak for easy access to your money). You can use the money in an MMA to pay for things with checks or a debit card.

But there are some downsides to an MMA: The bank limits the number of times you can withdraw your MMA money in a month (usually only six times). Plus, there’s a higher minimum balance compared to typical accounts, and you’ll get slapped with a wonderful account maintenance fee if you don’t maintain that balance.

Keep in mind, this is a place for money like your emergency fund or savings you plan to use in five years or less. The interest you’ll earn likely won’t keep up with inflation, so that makes it a bad choice for a long-term investment.

Those are just some of the most common types of investing and savings accounts, and which one you should choose depends on your investing goal and whether you’re investing for the long term or saving for the short term. It’s never a bad idea to talk with a financial advisor so they can answer any questions you have before opening an account.

Types of Investments
Let’s talk about the most common types of investments and why we always recommend mutual funds for long-term investing.

Bonds

A bond is a kind of loan between an investor and a corporate or government borrower that promises to repay the money with interest. They’re kind of like the certificates of deposit (CDs) of the investing world: easy to set up, relatively low risk, but often low reward.

Bonds have a reputation for being “lower-risk” investments because they don’t fluctuate as wildly as stocks. But lower risk doesn’t mean no risk. When interest rates rise, like they have been lately, bond values fall. And even in “good” times for bonds, the returns just aren’t that impressive (especially when compared to mutual funds) because they barely outpace inflation. Remember, you want to beat the market so you can build wealth.

Single Stocks

Stocks are basically tiny pieces, or shares, of a company. When a company goes public, they sell shares of the company to investors to fund future company growth. Picture a pizza cut up into tiny slices. If you buy a slice, you actually become a part owner in the company.

When you invest in single stocks, you’re putting all your money into one particular company, and that’s extremely risky. It’s better to diversify your money, especially if you’re just getting started in investing.

Once you’re full steam ahead with Baby Step 4, then you can consider single stocks as an additional investment. But stocks should never make up more than 10% of your portfolio—and be prepared to lose money if the company you’re invested in takes a nosedive.

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are similar to index funds. They invest in stocks from the companies included on a particular index, but here’s the twist—they’re bought and sold like single stocks.

ETFs and index funds are passive investments, meaning no one is managing your investments for you. That can mean lower fees, but the trade-off is that you’re on your own. Wait to invest in low turnover ETFs in a taxable investment account after you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts.

Mutual Funds

The best way to invest for long term, consistent growth is to put your money into good growth stock mutual funds. A mutual fund is an investment that pools money from a group of people to buy stocks in different companies.

Unlike ETFs and index funds, mutual funds are actively managed, meaning an investment professional makes decisions about how to invest the fund’s money. Also, there are thousands of mutual funds, which means you can choose funds that have a long history of outperforming other funds in their category.

What types of mutual funds should you pick? Great question. Let’s talk about how to build your investment strategy with mutual funds.

3. Pick an Investment Strategy
Like we said earlier, good growth stock mutual funds are the best way to invest for long-term, consistent growth. Why is that? Because they let you spread your investment among many companies—from the largest and most stable to the new and fast-growing. Spreading your money around like this is an important investing principle called diversification, and it helps you avoid the risks that come with buying single stocks.

Ever heard the expression, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket?” Well, mutual funds put your eggs in many different baskets. And we recommend spreading those eggs out even more by investing in four types of mutual funds:

Growth and income funds (also called large-cap funds): These are the most stable and predictable funds because they invest in stable, predictable companies. 
 
Growth funds (also called mid-cap funds): These are fairly stable funds that invest in growing companies. They’re slightly more risky and come with the potential for higher reward.
 
Aggressive growth funds (also called small-cap funds): These are the wild-child funds. You’re never sure what they’re going to do, which makes them higher risk, and potentially higher-return, funds.
 
International funds: These funds invest in foreign-owned businesses.
One of the biggest myths out there is that millionaires take big risks with their money to become wealthy. That couldn’t be further from the truth!

The Ramsey Solutions research team conducted the largest survey of millionaires ever done, called The National Study of Millionaires. Our team talked to more than 10,000 millionaires so we could finally get a clear picture of what a real millionaire looks like and how they built their seven-figure net worth.

Guess how many of them said single stocks were one of their top three wealth-building tools. The answer? Zero. Not a single one!

4. Open an Investing Account
Once you reach Baby Step 4, you’re ready to start investing for retirement. So where do you start? It’s pretty simple:

Start with your workplace plan. Most employers offer a match when you invest in your workplace retirement plan (a 401(k) or Roth 401(k) for most people). If you don’t have a Roth option, invest up to the match in your 401(k), then skip to the next step. If you do have a Roth option and you have a selection of good growth stock mutual funds to choose from, you can invest your entire 15% at work and you’re done.
 
Open a Roth IRA. Like we said before, the Roth IRA is the rock star of retirement plans. You can invest in the best mutual funds, and you won’t have to pay taxes on the growth in the account when you use it in retirement. Max out a Roth IRA for yourself and your spouse if you’re married.
 
Go back to your workplace plan. If you’ve maxed out your Roth IRA and you still haven’t reached your 15% goal, bump up your contributions to your 401(k) until you do.
 

It’s super easy to start investing in your employer-sponsored retirement plan. Here’s how to open an account:   

Check with your HR department to see if you’re eligible. A lot of companies will allow you to enroll as soon as you’re hired, but some require you to hit the one-year mark before you become eligible.
Fill out any required paperwork and submit it to HR online or in person.
Pick and choose your investments.
Set up automatic contributions.
Opening a Roth IRA is just as easy:

Set up an account online with help from an investing professional.
Fill out that pesky paperwork.
Pick and choose your investments.
Set up automatic contributions.
Your investing professional can also help you open an account and choose your investments to save for your kid’s college. And once your house is paid off, you can max out your tax-advantaged retirement accounts and even open a taxable investing account if you’re interested in investing in more mutual funds, stocks or ETFs.

5. Work with a Pro to Start Investing and Keep Learning
The last step to set yourself up for investing success is to actually start investing. Don’t let 2023’s economy or the scary, exaggerated news about everything that’s wrong with the stock market or the housing market keep you from getting on board. Instead, get with an investing expert who can give you real knowledge and guidance about starting your investing journey.

You’ll have lots of questions—it’s a given. Which are the best funds to choose? How do I manage my 401(k) or set up a Roth IRA? Your investment professional can show you how to start investing and answer all your questions so you can make the best decisions possible for your retirement savings.

The right investment professional will:

Educate you on investment choices so you stay in the driver’s seat
Help you keep your investments on track with regular check-ins
Offer a client-first approach

156,Not Misleading,"Simply put, investing can help you get ahead in life. It can be key to helping you grow your worth over time and provide the kind of future for yourself and your family that you dream about. It has the potential to let you literally earn money in your sleep. So there's no doubt that it's worth your time to figure out how it all works.

However, when you're new, it's a lot. A lot of choices, a lot of new words and concepts, and a lot of complicated, often-competing advice to sift through. And because it has to do with risking your money, it can be stressful too.

But just because it can be complicated doesn't mean it has to be. There are actually only a few main choices you have to make to start investing. Let's break it all down—no nonsense.

Step 1: Figure out what you're investing for
You might be thinking, ""But wait, shouldn't my first step be to find some hot, secret stock picks that I can ride to the moon?"" But in truth, successful investing generally starts with what you're investing for, not what you're investing in.

Lots of people start off by investing for retirement. In fact, we believe that for many people, investing something toward retirement should be pretty high up on your financial to-do list (falling after making minimum debt payments and building up a cash buffer; learn more about where investing should fall within your other financial priorities).

Although answering this question may not be as exciting as hunting down stock tips, it can help all the other pieces of your investing puzzle fall into place.

Step 2: Choose an account type
What you're investing for can also help you pick an account to open. Chances are, you'll want to start investing with one of these 3 main account types:

Brokerage account: When people talk about trading stocks, they're typically talking about doing so in a brokerage account. You can think of a brokerage account as your standard-issue investment account. Here are the basics:

Pros—Flexibility. Anyone age 18 or older can open one.1 You can add as much money as you want to the account, whenever you want, and have access to a wide range of investment options. You can also generally withdraw any cash in the account whenever you want.
Cons—Taxes. While a brokerage account may be the simplest to open and start using, it's typically the most expensive come tax time. That's because you generally have to pay taxes on any investment profits every year (like if you've sold investments for a gain, or received dividends or interest).
When to consider. Most commonly used for investing and trading the full range of investment options for either specific goals or just building wealth as you’re accumulating assets. If you're investing for retirement, it generally makes more sense to first start with one of the next 2 account types. That said, as long as you choose an account with no fees or minimums, there's no harm in going ahead and opening a brokerage account so you have it at the ready. (Fidelity charges $0 account fees and has no minimums for opening or maintaining a brokerage account.)2
401(k): This is an employer-sponsored plan account for investing for retirement. You can generally only invest in one through work. If you're not sure if you have access to one, check with your employer's HR department. Some people may instead have access to a 403(b) or 457(b) account, which are similar. Here are the tradeoffs:

Pros—Tax benefits, plus potentially free money. 401(k) plans offer tax-deferred investment growth. This means that you can contribute to the account pre-tax, and you generally don't pay any taxes while your money is sitting in the account potentially growing. Instead, you only pay income taxes when you take withdrawals (learn more about the benefits). Many employers will also match your contributions, up to a certain amount—it's like free money to encourage you to contribute. Your 401(K) may offer a Roth option as well. Here, you contribute after-tax but withdrawals are generally income tax-free.
Cons—Rules and restrictions. There are rules to follow on when and how you can contribute, and strict rules on when and how you can take money out. You may also be limited in what investments you can buy, and you can't necessarily buy specific stocks.
When to consider. For most people, the benefits easily outweigh the drawbacks. Many people start investing for the first time in these accounts. Chances are that if your employer offers a 401(k) or similar account, it's worth your while to invest in yours.
Individual retirement account (IRA): This is an account for retirement that you can open and invest in on your own (i.e., not through work). Although there are different types of IRAs, here we're focusing on traditional IRAs, which you can think of as the plain-vanilla kind. Here's what you need to know:

Pros—Tax benefits. Traditional IRAs come with similar tax benefits as 401(k)s. You also often get a bit more flexibility and control than you do with a 401(k). For example, you can pretty much contribute whenever you feel like it, and you may have more investment choices. You can typically even trade individual stocks.
Cons—Rules and restrictions. There are rules and restrictions on who's eligible to contribute to an IRA, how much you can contribute each year, and how and when you can take money out. Also, if you do decide to open an IRA, you may have to spend some time deciding which type of IRA to open.
When to consider. An IRA may be a good choice if you don't have a 401(k) or similar option at work. A traditional IRA, in particular, may be a good option if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when you retire. 
Roth IRAs may be a good choice for new investors and we can help you choose between the two in the account selector.
Still with us? You're doing great. And the next step is simpler—promise.

Step 3: Open the account and put money in it
The nuts and bolts of this step aren't too complicated, but you do still have some decisions to make.

Decision: Where to open your account? If you're opening a 401(k) then this part's easy: You'll open it through work, with whatever company is handling your employer's 401(k). With an IRA or brokerage account, you'll need to choose a financial institution to open your account with. (Here's how to open an account if you choose to go with Fidelity.)

Decision: How much money to invest? With a 401(k), you contribute through payroll deductions, meaning the money is taken out of your paycheck automatically. You decide how much of your pay to contribute. If your employer offers matching contributions, consider investing at least enough to capture the full amount of the match. If you're opening an IRA or brokerage account, you can start by depositing a chunk of money, and then add to that when you're ready. There are no minimums to open an IRA or brokerage account with Fidelity.2

There's no one magic number for how much you need to start investing, or how much you should add each month, because the right number varies depending on your income, budget, and what other financial priorities you're juggling. But if you're getting stuck on this step, remember that starting small is better than not starting at all. 

Investing a little bit every month and gradually increasing that amount over time, as you get more comfortable, is a fine way to go. Eventually, consider aiming to save an amount equal to 15% of your income toward retirement each year (including any employer match). If you decide to invest in a brokerage account or IRA, consider setting up automatic contributions so you keep investing every month.

Step 4: Pick investments
This is the step that tends to trip people up. It can feel like other people know some secret to picking investments—like there's a trick that can help you choose only the best ones. But here's the truth: There isn't.

Investing is actually a lot like creating a healthy diet. Most people should focus on getting a broad range of common-sense investment types, rather than placing all your bets on a small number of high-promise investments. After all, turmeric and açai may be superfoods, but they still shouldn't be the only things you eat. Many people can be well-served by investing in a broad range of stocks and bonds—with more money in stocks if you're young or investing for a goal that's a long time away (read more about figuring out your big-picture investment mix).

But if you're new to the investing grocery store, how do you figure out what to put in your cart? There are 3 basic methods:

Buy individual stocks and bonds—This is the most complicated and labor-intensive way, but it's what many people think of when they hear ""investing."" If you want to go this route, you'll need to learn about researching stocks, building a diversified portfolio, and more. It's doable, but it can take a lot of time and a lot of cash to build your portfolio. Fortunately, there are easier ways for beginners to get started.
Buy 1 or more funds or ETFs—Mutual funds and ETFs are packages of stocks and bonds, almost like a prefilled grocery basket you can buy. You can use them like building blocks, putting a few together to create a portfolio. Or, you can buy an all-in-one fund, which is an easy-to-manage diversified portfolio in a single fund. If you're investing in a 401(k) or IRA, one option to consider is a target-date fund—an all-in-one professionally managed fund that's specifically designed with a target retirement date in mind.
Hire a professional manager—If you're getting stuck, consider getting help. While this may sound like it's only an option for the wealthy, there are low-cost options that can meet your needs too. For example, robo advisors can offer low-to-no-cost professional management, because the day-to-day money management is handled by computers rather than live humans.
And of course, plenty of people end up deciding to use some mix of those options—like investing in funds with their retirement money, but perhaps also picking individual stocks with a small portion of their money. There's nothing wrong with mixing and matching. Whatever options you're considering, just be sure also to consider any fees, expenses, or commissions.

Step 5: Buy the investments
Game time, folks. Planning and research are great, but in the end, you also have to pull the trigger. For stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs, you'll generally look up the investment's ticker symbol—a string of 1 to 5 letters that's unique to that investment—then decide on a dollar amount or number of shares to buy (if you're getting stuck on this step, check out a more detailed walk-through of the process or some frequently asked questions).

In a 401(k), it's often easiest to set up your investment choices when you're setting your regular contribution amount, in which case your money will be invested in the choices you've selected automatically, corresponding with your pay cycle.

Step 6: Relax (but also keep tabs on your investments)
You're now an investor! Give yourself a pat on the back, but also try to keep up your momentum by continuing to build your knowledge base.

Now that you have a portfolio, try to remember that it's normal for investments to bounce around over the short term. (In fact, there's evidence that the more often you check your investments the riskier they seem, because you notice more of these short-term blips.3) Try to stay focused on the big picture, like your long-term investing goals and your total portfolio's performance.

Over time, you'll want to periodically (at least annually) check in on your plan, including:

Whether the account or accounts you're using are still a good fit for your situation.
Whether you're regularly contributing enough to your investments (chances are you'll be able to increase your contributions over time).
Whether your big-picture investment mix, and the specific investments you own, are still a good fit for your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
If that still feels like a lot, you don't have to do it all alone. You may be able to work with a financial professional through your retirement plan at work, or with a firm like Fidelity. There are plenty of options to choose from if you feel like you could use some guidance."

158,Not Misleading,"5 Steps to Start Investing
1. Determine your investing approach
The first thing to consider is how to start investing in stocks. Some investors choose to buy individual stocks, while others take a less active approach.

Try this. Which of the following statements best describes you?

I'm an analytical person and enjoy crunching numbers and doing research.
I hate math and don't want to do a ton of ""homework.""
I have several hours each week to dedicate to stock market investing.
I like to read about the different companies I can invest in, but don't have any desire to dive into anything math-related.
I'm a busy professional and don't have the time to learn how to analyze stocks.
The good news is that regardless of which of these statements you agree with, you're still a great candidate to become a stock market investor. The only thing that will change is the ""how.""

The different ways to invest in the stock market
Individual stocks
You can invest in individual stocks if -- and only if -- you have the time and desire to thoroughly research and evaluate stocks on an ongoing basis. If this is the case, we 100% encourage you to do so. It is entirely possible for a smart and patient investor to beat the market over time. On the other hand, if things like quarterly earnings reports and moderate mathematical calculations don't sound appealing, there's absolutely nothing wrong with taking a more passive approach.

Index funds
In addition to buying individual stocks, you can choose to invest in index funds, which track a stock index like the S&P 500. When it comes to actively vs. passively managed funds, we generally prefer the latter (although there are certainly exceptions). Index funds typically have significantly lower costs and are virtually guaranteed to match the long-term performance of their underlying indexes. Over time, the S&P 500 has produced total returns of about 10% annualized, and performance like this can build substantial wealth over time.

Robo-advisors
Finally, another option that has exploded in popularity in recent years is the robo-advisor. A robo-advisor is a brokerage that essentially invests your money on your behalf in a portfolio of index funds that is appropriate for your age, risk tolerance, and investing goals. Not only can a robo-advisor select your investments, but many will also optimize your tax efficiency and make changes over time automatically.

2. Decide how much you will invest in stocks
First, let's talk about the money you shouldn't invest in stocks. The stock market is no place for money that you might need within the next five years, at a minimum.

While the stock market will almost certainly rise over the long run, there's simply too much uncertainty in stock prices in the short term -- in fact, a drawdown of 20% in any given year isn’t unusual, and occasional drops of 40% or even more happen. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the market plunged by more than 40% -- though it rebounded to an all-time high within a few months.

So here's what you shouldn't be investing:

Your emergency fund
Money you'll need to make your child's next tuition payment
Next year's vacation fund
Money you're socking away for a down payment, even if you will not be prepared to buy a home for several years"

160,Not Misleading,"Right, so let's say you want to get started with this investing thing. You might have a bit of money saved. It's probably not enough for a house, but you reckon I should probably invest this in something. Maybe you've heard on the news about Tesla or Netflix or Amazon and how, if you'd invested 10 years ago in Tesla then you'd be a millionaire by now or things like that. But if you're new to the game, this whole investment thing can seem like a really complicated black box. Like, how do you even buy a stock? What even is a stock? Do you just go on tesla.com and buy some Tesla, like, how does it work? (chuckles) And if you try and look into this, you get all these acronyms being thrown around like Roth IRAs and 401Ks in America or like ISAs or LISAs in the UK. And on top of that, there is the anxiety that we all have that I know investing is risky and I don't want to lose all that my money. So in light of all of that, this is the ultimate guide on how to get started with investing. It is the video I wish I would have had five years ago when I first started investing in stocks and shares. And we're gonna cover this by thinking about investing in 10 different bite size steps. So the first one is forgetting about investing completely and just thinking what happens to my money over time by default. And if you've studied economics, you will know that your money loses its value over time. Thanks to something called inflation. (bubble pops) Inflation is generally around about the 2%-2.5% mark. And so that means that every year stuff costs about 2% more than it did the year before. For example, in 1970, in America a cup of coffee cost of 25 cents. But in 2019, that same cup of coffee costs a $1 59. That is inflation in action. And so let's say you've got a thousand pounds in your hand right now. And for the next 10 years, you just stash it under your mattress. And you never look at it again, in 10 years time your thousand pounds is not gonna be worth a thousand pounds anymore because everything would have increased by 2%ish every year. So the value of your money will have fallen. And so if you put your thousand pounds under your mattress for 10 years, you will lose money over time. And this is obviously not good. Even if you put your money in a savings account, like these days, a savings account will give you like 0.2% interest which means your money goes up by 0.2% every year. But because inflation is up by 2% you're still losing money over time. And again, this is not good. Okay, so that begs the question which is key point number two which is how do we stop our money from losing value over time? And the answer is that if we had a hypothetical savings account one that was let's say an interest rate of 2.5% that would match roughly the rate of inflation. So inflation means everything goes up by 2.5% in terms of price. But our money in our savings account also goes up by 2.5% each year. Therefore we're technically not losing money over time. If you're watching this and you have an issue with the word interest, don't worry stick to it for now, investment is not the same as interest but we'll come back to that a bit later. But the point here is that we don't just want to not lose money which is what happens at our 2.5% rate. We actually want to make money. And that brings us on to question number three which is, well, how do we actually make money? Now, let's go back to our hypothetical savings account. If hypothetically, we could have a savings account that was giving us a 10% interest rate this will never happen because that's just way too high. But hypothetically if it did, that means that every year we'd be making 10% of the value of the money in our savings account. So for example, if I were to put a hundred pounds in a savings account right now the next year it would be worth 110. And then the year after it will be 121 because it's 10% of then the 110, and then it would be 130 something. And this would very quickly compound so that in 10 years time, my 100 pounds will have become 259 pounds. And if we adjust for inflation that our money is still worth 206 pounds in 10 years time, this is pretty good. We have more than doubled our money, by just putting it in this hypothetical 10% interest savings account. And it really doesn't seem like it would do that because 10% feels like a small amount of money. But if you extrapolate 10% over 10 years you actually double your money, which is pretty awesome. Sadly these hypothetical 10% saving accounts don't really exist, because it's just way too high and real life is not that nice. These days, most savings accounts in the UK and I imagine around the rest of the world as well, offer less than a 1% savings rate, which means you're actually still losing money over time. But we do have other options to try and get us to this magical Nirvana of like, you know, this 10% saving thingy. And that is where investments come in. So point number four is what is an investment? And the answer is that an investment is something that puts money in your pocket. For example, let's say you buy a house for a hundred 1000 pounds and you want to rent it out to people. There are two ways, that's an investment. There are two ways you're making money from it. Firstly, let's say you're charging some rent to the people living in your house. Let's say you're charging them 830 pounds a month. That becomes 10,000 pounds a year. And so every year you're making 10,000 pounds in rental income, which is 10% of what you originally paid for the house. That means that in 10 years time you'll have paid off the a 100,000 pounds that you've put in because you're making 10K a year. And beyond that every year you're just making 10,000 pounds in pure profit. So that's pretty good. But secondly, it's an investment because the value of the house itself would probably rise over time. In general, there is a trend in most developed countries that house prices tend to rise over the longterm. And so your house will probably be worth more than a hundred thousand pounds in 10 years time. And in fact in the UK, historically in the past, some people have said that house prices have doubled every 10 years. So maybe your house is worth close to 200,000 pounds. And so you've made money off of the rental income but you've also made money off of the capital gains which is what we call it when an asset increases in value over time. But the problem is that buying a house is a little bit annoying. You need to have quite a large amount of money for a deposit. You need to get a mortgage. You need to actually have the house. You just sought out the rental management, rent it out to people, all that kind of stuff. If only there were a way of investing without a, having a large amount of money to start with and b, without having to put that much effort into managing the assets as well. And that brings us on to investing in shares. And for me, basically, a hundred percent of my investment portfolio is entirely shares. I have a tiny percentage in Bitcoin and I own this house but I don't consider this house an investment. I'll talk about that in a different video. Therefore number five is what are shares and how do they work? So buying shares probably as close as we're ever gonna get to this magical savings account that just returns some amount of money each year. And the idea is that when you buy a share, you are buying a part ownership of the company that you've got the share in. For example, let's say the Apple have a particularly profitable year because lots of people have well iPads as per my recommendations and because Apple are feeling kind, they are choosing to pay out a dividend to their shareholders. So for example they might say that they're gonna issue a dividend of a million pounds, and that's gonna be split evenly amongst whoever owns shares in Apple, based on how many shares they own. So for example, if you happen to own 1% of Apple you would get 1% of that dividend that they've issued. So 1% of a million pounds, which is 10,000 pounds obviously no one watching this actually owns 1% of Apple, unless Tim Cook, you're watching, I don't even know if you own that much because that would make you an extremely rich person because Apple is a very valuable company but that's basically how the dividend thing works. A company decides to issue a dividend as a way of returning some of its profit back to the people who have invested in the company. And therefore you make money through dividends. The second way of making money from shares is sort of like with houses in that you get the capital gains over time. So for example, let's say you bought 10 shares in Apple in 2010, at the time those shares were selling for $9 each. So yoU.S.pent $90 on buying 10 shares in Apple. As of October, 2020, Apple shares sell for $115. So your 10 shares are now worth $1,150 just by the fact that you only paid $90 for them 10 years ago. Okay, so we've talked about what a share is and how you make money from them. And at this point you've probably got a few questions like how much money you need to get started or how risky is buying shares in a company. And I promise we're gonna get to that. But point number six is how the hell do you buy a share in the first place? And this is where it can kind of get complicated because it's not as simple as going on apple.com/buy and just buying a share in Apple. It doesn't quite work like that. Instead you have to go through, what's called a broker. And back in the day, a stockbroker was a physical person usually a dude who you would call on the phone and say ""Hey, Bob, I want to place an order for some shares in Apple."" And then Bob would types and stuff into his computer or a place like a paper order. And then you would own shares in Apple. Thankfully these days we don't really have to talk to Bob because there's loads and loads of online brokers instead. And so you make an account on an online broker and then you can buy shares in a company through that. A bit annoyingly, every different country has their own different brokers that operate in that country. Because to be an online broker in a country you have to abide by like a zillion different laws. And so in the UK the system is different to the U.S. which is different to Canada and Germany and so on. And the UK, for example, most banks do have their own online brokerage type things. So with most bank accounts you can also open an investment account with them and then invest online. But usually the interface is a bit clunky. It's a bit old fashioned. And so you're usually better off going with an online broker. In the UK, the two that I use are Charles Stanley Direct and Vanguard, but before we get ahead of ourselves and make an account on Vanguard or whatever, we need to understand a few more things. And so question number seven is how the hell do I decide which shares to buy? And the easy answer to that is that you actually don't want to figure out which shares to buy. You do not want to buy individual shares. And I'm gonna tell you a little bit more about that once I've had a haircut, so see you shortly. All right? So new hair, I've got my Invisalign braces on. So I'm gonna sound a little bit different but where were we? Oh yeah, we were talking about why it's not a good idea generally speaking to invest in individual stocks. And I'm gonna do a video about this some other time, but essentially the issue with investing in individual stocks is it's kind of risky. Like, yes, if you invest in something like Apple, chances are it's gonna be around 10 years from now. But historically there've been quite a few companies that people were like, ""Oh my God, this is amazing. This is the thing to invest in."" And then that company went bust. So you're automatically exposing yourself to more risk if you're investing in individual stock, also in general, like it's easy to say, hey, Amazon grew 10X in the last 10 years. Therefore it's gonna continue to do the same for the next 10 years. But that's trying to predict the future. And the past is no real indication of future performance. And so the advice that most people would give for beginners is that you should not invest in individual stocks. You should invest in index funds. And this is what Graham Stephan, one of my favorite YouTubers also says as well. He says, ""The index funds are the best, safest, and easiest longterm investment strategy for most people."" Which begs the question point number eight, what the hell is an index fund? So there's basically two bits to understand here there's the index bit and the fund bit, let's start with the fund bit. And a fund is basically where investors will pool their money, so multiple investors would invest in the same fund. And then that fund would have a fund manager. And the fund manager decides which companies the fund is gonna invest in. For example, let's say I were managing a fund and I called it Gringotts and let's say a hundred people from my audience decided to invest in my Gringotts fund. I as the fund manager can say, okay, the Gringotts fund now that we have a hundred people's money let's say it's a 100 million. So everyone's invested 1 million each I've now got a 100 million. I'm gonna put 20% of that in Apple, 10% in Facebook, 10% in Amazon, 10% in Tesla, 10% of Netflix 10% in Johnson and Johnson, all of that sort of stuff. And so you, the investor don't have to worry about this because you trust me and my fund Gringotts to manage your money. And as you know, the fund performs well, because the prices of these stocks and shares increases you get the returns and I take a 1% or 2% management fee. So I make a load of money because I'm earning 1% or 2% off of this a 100 million that I'm managing and you're not worrying about having to pick stocks yourself. You trust me as a seasoned professional to do that for you. So that's what a fund is. Now, the index bit refers to a stock market index. And so a stock market index would for example, be the FTSE 100 which is the a hundred biggest companies in the UK or the S&P 500, which is the 500 biggest companies in the U.S. or the NASDAQ or the Dow. And these are all different indices of the stock market. And if we use the S&P 500, for example, these are the components of the S&P 500. So we said, it's the 500 biggest companies in the U.S. So number one is Apple and Apple makes up 6.5% of the S&P, Microsoft makes up 5.5, Amazon makes it 4.7, Facebook has 2.2, Alphabet, which is a Google makes 1.5 and 1.5 is about 3% of the total S&P 500. And essentially we've got these 500 companies if you go all the way down... Oh, Ralph Lauren is 496, but chances are, you've not really heard of many of the other ones at the bottom of the list but chances are, you've heard of most of the companies towards the top of the list. So the S&P 500 is an index of the U.S. stock market. And if you look at the performance as a whole of the S&P 500, you get a general idea of how the U.S. economy is going as a whole. So this is currently what the S&P 500 looks like and if we do a five year time horizon, in fact, let's go max. So you can see the S&P 500 started in 1980. And since that time this is what the us stock market has been doing. So as you can see, there is a general trend upwards but for example in 2000, there was a bit of a crash, in 2008 famously there was a bit of a crash. And earlier this year, when Corona was first starting to be a thing there was a bit of a crash but then the market basically immediately recovered after that. Okay, so we know what a fund is, i.e. a way of pooling money. And we know what the index is, something like the S&P 500, when you combine those, you get an index fund which is a fund that automatically invests in all of the companies in the index. And so with me, for example basically all of my investments, all of my money is in the S&P 500, which effectively means that 6.5% of my investments are in Apple, 5.5 in Microsoft, 4.7 in Amazon, 2.2 in Facebook, 3% in Google, 1.5 in Berkshire Hathaway and so on. So why is this good? Well, it's good for a lot of reasons. So firstly index funds are really, really easy to invest in. A big problem that beginners have to investing, it's like, well, how the hell do I know which company to invest in? How do I read a balance sheet? How do I do any of this stuff? If you invest in an index fund, you actually don't have to worry about any of that. Secondly, index funds give you a decent amount of diversification. There are all sorts of companies in the S&P 500. So you're not entirely reliant on the tech sector or the oil sector or the clothing sector or anything to make the bulk of your money. You are very nicely diversified across all these U.S. companies. Thirdly, index funds have very low fees. So because it's not a real person who is deciding what to invest in and doing all this research and trying to make loads of money is essentially a computer algorithm that automatically allocate your money based on the components of the index fund. The fees for those are really low. And one of the main things about investing for the longterm is that even a slight increase in your fees is gonna massively impact your financial upside. And so for example, an index fund with a 0.1% fee is so much better for you than an actively managed fund where a fund manager is charging you even 1% because the longterm difference between 0.1% fees and a 1% fee is sort of absolutely astronomical over the long term. And finally, if you look historically and, you know technically historical performance is not the same thing as future performance, but if you look historically very few funds have managed to actually consistently beat the market i.e. outperform the index. And in fact, someone like Warren Buffet famously says that if you gave him a hundred thousand pounds and asked him to invest it right now he would just invest in an index fund, like the S&P 500. And in fact, in 2008 Warren Buffet challenged the hedge fund industry to try and beat the market. He said that hedge funds are a bit pointless because they charge way too high fees and they don't actually get the sort of returns they claim to get. And so he set up this 10 year bet which this company called Protege Partners LLC accepted, where Buffett said that he was gonna bet that the index fund outperformed the actively managed fund. And he ended up winning that bet and sort of gave lots of money for charity or something like that. But that just sort of goes to show that it's really hard to beat the market with an actively managed fund. Basically, no one can predict what the market is gonna do in the future. And therefore if you hit your ride on index, i.e. you're gambling on the entire market, rather than thinking, you know what I've got some amazing insight that I'll know exactly which 10 stocks to pick that are gonna beat the market. You might as well hit your ride with the whole market rather than individual stocks. Okay, so we've sorted out the problem of which stocks to invest in by completely circumventing the problem and instead, just investing in index funds. The next big question people usually have about investing in stocks and shares is the amount of risk. And that brings us to point number nine. And the argument usually goes as follows that, ""Hey, okay cool. This investing in stocks and shares stuff. It sounds kind of interesting, but my uncle Tom Cobley, invested lots of money in the stock market. And he lost a lot of money. And my parents have told me that investing in the stock market is a really risky thing and I shouldn't do it. And I should instead invest in real estate because real estate is safe."" That is usually the sort of thing, the sort of idea that people have about investing in stocks. And naturally there is the anxiety of what if I lose all my money. So let's talk about that now. So if we take a step back, the only way to lose money in anything is if you buy a thing and then you sell it for less than you actually bought it. Like, let's say you bought a house for 300,000 pounds, and then Brexit happens the next day and the house prices plummet. And now your house is only worth 250,000. At that point, if you decide to sell your house, then yes you are losing money and you've lost 50,000 pounds. Equally, the only way to really lose money in stocks is if you buy a stock at a certain price and then you sell it for less than that price. So for example, let's say you bought shares in Apple on the 18th of February, 2020. And let's say you bought one share which time was $79 and 75 cents. And because this is your first time in investing you keep on looking at the price of the Apple stock because every time are you thinking, oh, have I made money, have I made money? And really annoyingly for you, you see that over the next kind of few days a few weeks, Apple stock is actually going down. And then on the 18th of March, 2020, you decide screw it. I'm gonna sell my one share on Apple, because I don't want to lose all my money. And you sell it for a measly price of $61.67. And so you technically lost $18 because you bought it at $79 in February, and you've sold it for $61 in March. Then you think, damn, I've lost 20% of my investment. This stock market thing is BS. I'm never gonna invest in the stock market again, and you call it a day. And this would be a very bad thing to do. Because for example, if we look at Apple stock price in March, it was $57.31 but if you just held onto your one Apple share in that time, what is it today? It's the 8th of October. Apple is now trading at $114.96. So if you just held on for a few months, you would actually made a lot of money. You would have bought it at $79 and within, I don't know eight months, it would now be worth $115. That's a pretty good game. And so the real lesson here is that when you're investing in stocks and shares, and also when you're investing in real estate, these are longterm investments. Ideally, you shouldn't be putting any money into stocks and shares that you need to access within the next five years. And actually a lot of people would extend that to 10 years. And it's exactly like that with house prices, it's like if you buy a house as an investment, and then the houses house prices go down it would be completely stupid of you to sell the house unless you are absolutely desperate for the money, because something major has happened. And instead, if you just held onto the house then you would have made more money in the long run because in the longterm house prices always go up and in the longterm basically the stock market always goes up and that's a bit of, it can be a controversial statement. It is true, but I'm gonna make a video at some other point explaining why it's true but for now take my word for it that over the long term, the stock market always goes up. But having said that again, this is a longterm thing. And so, for example, if we look at the S&P 500 and look at how it was in 2008 at the financial crash right in 2007, it's $1,500 per bit of the S&P 500. And then the crash happens and then by what is it? February, 2009, it's down to 735. So basically 50% of the value has been wiped off of the S&P 500. Now, if you bought it in 2007 and you saw it, you know, get a crushing and crashing and crashing, and then you sold when it was $800. Now, you've lost a lot of money because you bought high and you sold low. But if you just held on, it took let's see, to June 2007 it's at 1500s, it takes about up until 2013. So it takes about five years for it to get back to its normal level. And even if you'd invested, like just before the crash and then your investment plummeted by 50%, if you would just held on you'd have bought in at the S&P 500 at 1500. And right now it would be 3,445. So since 2008, 2007, when he first invested over the last 13 years the S&P 500 has more than doubled. So you would have more than doubled your money, provided you did not panic sell when the market crashed. Now, hypothetically could the market crashed down to zero and therefore you will actually lose all your money. Yes, it could, but if the us stock market crashed literally to zero i.e. all top 500 companies, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, like literally every company in the top, in the S&P 500, all of those got destroyed overnight. And the stock market crashed to zero. The world would be in some sort of mega apocalypse and you'd have a lot more serious problems to worry about rather than the value of your portfolio, of stock market indices on Vanguard. In that scenario, in that doomsday scenario money would stop meaning anything and you'd be using money to wipe your bum because money has no value because the stock market is completely crashed. It's basically unfathomable that the global economy could be so completely wrecked, such that every single company goes down to zero. In my opinion, and again, you know, I'm not a financial advisor. This is technically not financial advice whatever that means, but in my opinion it's unrealistic to think that if I put my money in stocks and shares, I could lose all of it. There's basically no way you're ever gonna lose all of it provided you're diversified. If you invested in, I don't know, Myspace in 2000 and whatever it was, and then Myspace crushes and then you've lost all your money because, you know, they have no money, but if you invest in the top 500 companies in the U.S. or the top 500 companies in the world, or the top 100 companies in the UK, it is so vanishingly unlikely that you will ever lose your money. That I don't think that is a risk that we should even be thinking about. So realistic, worst case scenario, yes, investing in the stock market is risky in the short term, but if you're investing in the longterm, the market will always go up and you will always end up making more money in the long run provided you don't have to take money out at inopportune times. Okay, so at this point, we've established that investing in stocks is very good and investing in index funds is a relatively safe way of doing this. The next question is usually when should you get started? Like how old do you have to be? Is it ever too soon to start? Is it ever too late to start? And here the answer is pretty simple. And basically all investment advice agrees with me on this front. There's a very good website called The Motley Fool @fool.com. and they have a nice article explaining this. Basically, you should start investing as soon as possible. It doesn't matter how old you are. It doesn't matter how young you are. The earlier you start investing the better. There are three caveats though for like sensible financial advice. Firstly, you wanna make sure that all of your high interest i.e. credit card debt is paid off, because when it comes to compounding even though gains compound, losses compound as well. And so if you've got like a 6% credit card debt that's eating into your bottom line every single month you want to pay that off as soon as possible. Point number two is that you want to make some sort of emergency fund. And people usually say that your emergency fund should have in cash basically three to six months of living expenses so that if you lose your job or if you're hit with some kind of incredible medical emergency, and you're not in the UK where medical care is free, or you're in the U.S. or something like that, then you've got money to do that. And you don't have to take money out of your investments. And caveat number three is that you don't want to put any money into stocks that you think you might need to use in the next three to five years. So let's say you're 24 and you've just landed your first job. And you're thinking of getting a mortgage and buying a house and you need money for the deposit. Do not put that money into the S&P 500 or into any kind of stocks and shares because no one can time the market. And no one knows whether we might you know, there might be a market crash tomorrow. All we know is that in the longterm, the stock market goes up, but if you need to buy a house next year there is absolutely no guarantee that that money will still be worth exactly the same or worth more this time next year. So it provided those two conditions are met. Like firstly, you have no high interest credit card debt. And secondly, you've already got your emergency fund. And thirdly, you're not planning to gonna have a major expense in the next few years. At that point, absolutely everyone should be investing something into the stock market. In my opinion, whether you're 12 or 20 or 21 or 22 or 50, it doesn't matter. And as they say on the market floor there is almost no way your future self will regret making the decision to invest. And as you know at this point, this is because of compounding. The more time you leave your money in the stock market, the more it compounds. And there is a huge difference. There's like lots of interesting numbers about this on the internet that people have calculated that if you start investing at the age of 20, versus if you start investing at the age of 25 or 30, it makes such a huge difference to your bottom line. That basically, as soon as you watch this video and hear about investing, you should start investing provided those three conditions that we talked about are met. All right, so we're nearly there. Now, we're point 11 out of 12 where we said, okay, you sold me on this idea of investing in index funds. All of these three conditions are met. I don't have a high interest credit card debt. I've got my emergency fund, or I'm a student. And therefore my parents are my emergency fund and I'm not planning to buy a house or a big thing in the next three years. The next question is usually how much money do I need to get started with investing? And I know a lot of students watch my channel and I had a lot of comments on Instagram saying, ""I'm 14 years old and I don't have any money. How do I get started with investing?"" And the answer here is again, quite easy, basically start with whatever you can. For some of these websites and some of these apps that you can use to invest in stock market indices. You can start with as little as $5 or 10 pounds, depending on the website. You might need to start with a 100 pounds or a 1000 pounds. You can research this and it kind of depends on which country you're in, but basically you want to start investing as soon as possible. And it doesn't matter if it's a tiny amount of money to begin with. Firstly, it's useful to invest small amounts of money because compounding is always good. But secondly and more importantly, the sooner you start investing the sooner it becomes a habit. And so for me, for example, I started investing in 2015. I knew absolutely nothing about it before then, but I really wish I'd started investing in like 2009 when I first had my first part time job because a, that would have encouraged good financial habits within me. I would have kept aside maybe 10% or 20% from the top line to put into my investments. Secondly, it would have meant that investing became a habit. And so I would have known about the fact that stock market indices exist. I would have done the research. I would have watched videos like this, although these weren't really a thing in 2009. And what I'm really annoyed about with myself is I started making actual money in like 2012 when my first business started to do very well. And between 2012 and 2015, I did not invest any money just because I didn't know that you could. And I didn't know how and I always kinda thought that, ""Huh, I'm making money now."" It's just sort of sitting in my bank account. And I know that inflation is a thing. So I know my money's losing value but I just didn't think about investing and didn't realize how easy it is and that it's a thing. And so I really wish I'd started investing my real money in 2012, but the only way I would've done that is if I had started investing from 2009, when I first started making, I don't know, six pounds an hour during my part time job. So again, and I can't state this emphatically enough. Like it doesn't matter if all you have is a small amount to invest even if it's one pound, even if it's 10 P. The process of making the account and researching online stockbrokers in your country and figuring out how to actually do this stuff is like the most valuable thing that you could be doing with your time immediately after watching this video. And finally, point number 12 is okay, I'm sold, I've got a 100 pounds here and I want to put it inside a stock market index fund. How do I actually do that? 

And the answer here is you want to find an online broker. So this will vary massively depending on which country you're in, because these online brokers as I said, have like zillions of laws they have to comply with and financial regulations and all this stuff. In the U.S. most people that I know use the Vanguard as well. And my favorite blogger Mr. Money Mustache recommends that as well. Although in the U.S. there are also other services like Betterment, which I'd bet a few friends who use that as well. Again, depending on which country you're in, like literally all you have to do is Google the phrase, best online broker, Germany, or best online broker, Pakistan, or best online broker, India, whichever country you're in. And you'll find something, read some reviews. Basically the thing you're looking for is you want to be able to invest in index funds and you want the fees to be as low as possible. I think Charles Stanley Direct the fee is 0.25% which was the lowest at the time when I made my account and I think is still pretty competitive. So you want the fee to be like a really, really, really small fraction of a percentage. Then once you've made your account and verified your identity and gone through all the hoops and stuff which sometimes takes a few days, and they send you a letter to the post to verify your address, like depending on what the regulations are. Once you've done that then you can start just putting money in here and there. And all the friends that I've spoken to about this stuff over the last, like four years since I first started knowing about investing in things, they've all started making accounts and sort of making these investment counts for themselves. For the first few weeks they all sort of compulsively check their phones to see what the stock market is doing. But then very quickly you realize that actually I'm investing for the long term here. I actually don't give a toss what the stock market is doing in the short term. I check my portfolio once every six months just cause sometimes I'm curious. I don't even bother looking at it. This is very much a set it and forget it strategy, you're investing for the longterm. Your money will magically grow over time provided you don't touch it and think, ""Oh crap, the stock market's going down a bit. I'm gonna take my money, because I can't handle these losses."" There's loads more to say about investing in finance, but hopefully this was a reasonably concise, not very concise. This is gonna be a long video, but well, hopefully this was a reasonable introduction to how to get started with investing in index funds. If you have more questions about exactly what to do or anything else about money. Do leave a comment in the video description area thing. I'm still trying to think of a name for this series. I was thinking I posted on Instagram. There were a few options: Money talks, was quite a popular one, but that's already a film. One that I really liked was Penny Sitting. I think I might call this series Penny Sitting, that was kind of cool. A lot of people said like, financeshially, financially. 'cause my name's Alica, financially, a few different options. I mean the way you think, if you have any ideas for what this entire series about money and stuff should be called... And final piece of advice, if you're in the UK, if you're in the UK and you're just getting start with investing, basically go on Hargreaves Lansdown and make a Lifetime ISA. A Lifetime ISA is a very good deal. You can read more about it at moneysavingexpert.com within the Lifetime ISA as of 2020, you can put up to 4,000 pounds a year into it. And then you can invest that in the S&P 500, which is what I would do. If you have more than 4,000 pounds a year to invest you can then put another 16,000 into a stocks and shares ISA which I'd recommend doing on a vanguardinvestor.co.uk And if you have more than 20,000 pounds to invest in a year and you're doing really well then just open a general investment account with Vanguard. This is what I do, I think it works great. Loads more links in the video description to other resources and bloggers and books and other videos that I would recommend Graham Stephan, has an amazing YouTube channel, Andrei Jikh does a good job with YouTube channels as well, and Mr. Money Mustache amazing, amazing blog J L Collins' amazing blog with a Fantastic Stock series that you should definitely read. There's so much to explore in this area, and it's a really fascinating topic but thank you so much for watching this video. Hit the video here if you want to learn about how I make the money that I used to invest. It's my video about how to make money online. Thank you so much for watching. Good luck with investing. Make sure you invest in a stock market index fund. "
